It’s unclear whether the shooting influenced people’s views of Biden, but the small number of poll interviews completed after the shooting provided no early indication that his prospects improved.</p><p>Here\\'s what to know about the poll\\'s findings.</p><h>Democrats are somewhat less satisfied with Biden after debate</h><p>Only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that Biden has the mental capacity to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40% in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/February-2024-topline-Biden.pdf\">an AP-NORC poll in February</url>. Democrats are also slightly more likely to say they’re dissatisfied with Biden as their nominee now than they were before his halting debate performance. About half are dissatisfied, an uptick from about 4 in 10 in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/the-biden-trump-debate-is-seen-as-important-for-their-campaigns/\">an AP-NORC poll from June</url>.</p><h>Biden\\'s stronger with Black Democrats, weaker with young ones</h><p>The poll provides some evidence that Black Democrats are among Biden’s strongest supporters, with roughly half in the survey saying he should continue running. Younger Democrats are especially likely to want to see him bow out – and to say they’re dissatisfied with him. Three-quarters of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden to drop out.</p><h>Harris is viewed slightly less negatively than Biden</h><p>As Vice President Kamala Harris receives additional scrutiny amid the talk about whether Biden should bow out, the poll found that her favorability rating is similar to his, but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is slightly lower. Around 6 in 10 Democrats say Harris would make a good president, while about 2 in 10 think not.</p><h>Republicans more united around Trump</h><p>About 6 in 10 Americans also want Trump to withdraw -- but only about a quarter of Republicans say so. About 6 in 10 Republicans also came out of the debate very or somewhat satisfied with Trump as their candidate. (Too few interviews were conducted after the assassination attempt to provide a clear indication of whether Republicans or Americans overall have rallied further around Trump since then.)</p><h>Trump is seen as more capable of winning in November</h><p>Americans are much more likely to think Trump is capable of winning the 2024 election than is Biden – 42% to 18%. About a quarter thought the the two men equally capable of winning. Only about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable of winning than is Trump, while about 3 in 10 think the two are equally capable of winning and 16% say victory is more likely to go to the Republican. Republicans are overwhelmingly convinced Trump is best positioned to win.</p><h>Biden is seen as more honest than Trump</h><p>The poll did offer a bright spot for Biden: 40% of adults say he’s more honest than Trump, while about 2 in 10 think the opposite.</p><h>Most don\\'t know much about Vance</h><p>The survey was conducted before Trump selected freshman <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/jd-vance\">Sen. JD Vance of Ohio</url> as his running mate. It showed that for most Americans, Vance is still an unknown. Six in 10 don’t know enough about him to form an opinion, while 17% have a favorable view and 22% view him negatively.</p><p>—</p><p>The poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-70d9ed325e67e9d9897f3521d421d82a20240717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH3-PJR1-JC5B-G3Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"601\"/><timeReceived>6:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 17, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kennedy Jr., who suspended his presidential campaign on Friday and gave his support to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a speech made in Arizona, Kennedy cited concerns that continuing his campaign would help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Kennedy’s support appeared to have declined in recent polls as he struggled to find his political lane in a race reshaped by the departure of Democratic President Joe Biden and Harris’ nomination in his place. The developments left relatively narrow room for Kennedy’s presence — or departure — to make a difference in the election outcome. Recent polls don’t give a clear indication that Kennedy’s presence in the race had an outsized impact on support for either major-party candidate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While some polls earlier in the year put Kennedy’s support in the double digits, his support hovered in <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-poll-election-issues/story?id=112865487\">the mid-single digits</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/\">most recent polls</url>. It’s unclear if Kennedy would have even received that level of support in the general election, since third-party candidates frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-biden-trump-third-party-2024-election-71ffff6d34b0bad8b92cb8e82369d2e8\">don’t live up to their early poll numbers</url> when voters actually cast their ballots.</p><h>Partisan appeal</h><p>In recent months, Americans overall have been split in their views of Kennedy, 70, the son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.</p><p>About as many people had a favorable as unfavorable view of Kennedy, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-2024-W1-topline.pdf\">July AP-NORC poll</url> that was conducted before Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month. That marked a decline from February, when more had a positive than negative view of Kennedy, and about 3 in 10 did not have an opinion.</p><p>In the most recent poll, about 2 in 10 U.S. adults didn’t know enough about Kennedy to give an opinion.</p><p>Republicans were significantly more likely than Democrats and independents to have a favorable view of Kennedy. And those with a positive impression of Kennedy were more likely to also have a favorable view of Trump (52%) than Harris (37%).</p><p>Kennedy also struggled to endear himself to political independents. Although he was running as an independent presidential candidate, polling showed about 4 in 10 independents did not know enough to form an opinion. Those who did were divided equally between favorable and unfavorable opinions.</p><h>The base of support</h><p>Kennedy\\'s appeal largely rested on being an alternative to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-immigration-economy-inflation-abortion-21b95914866c2af3a1e7af8e302dbe27\">match-up many Americans dreaded</url> when Biden was facing Trump in a rematch of the 2020 election won by Biden. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/07/PP_2024.7.29_ukraine_REPORT.pdf#page=20\">Pew Research Center poll from July</url> found that about half of voters who were supporting Kennedy said the main reason they backed him was because he was neither Biden nor Trump, compared with about 3 in 10 who listed Kennedy\\'s characteristics or policies.</p><p>Harris’ move to the top of the Democratic ticket may have further harmed Kennedy’s prospects. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/\">August Pew poll</url> suggested that Harris had gained support at Kennedy’s expense. She appeared to have received the support of some women and non-white voters who previously were considering Kennedy.</p><h>About that family name</h><p>Kennedy’s initial pitch was largely focused on his family name and his relation to other famed Kennedys, including his father and his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23825119/cnn-poll-2024-democratic-primary.pdf#page=12\">CNN polling conducted last summer</url> when RFK Jr. was running for the Democratic nomination found that many Democrats said they’d consider supporting him because of the Kennedy name or his family connections. Many members of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-kennedy-rfk-trump-pennsylvania-b411e744d3b13fc6365029cb3dfd00c4\">Kennedy family endorsed Biden</url> before he withdrew from the race.</p><p>John F. Kennedy remains the most highly rated former president in <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/508625/retrospective-approval-jfk-rises-trump.aspx\">Gallup’s retrospective approval ratings</url>, and his appeal crosses party lines.

The poll was conducted mostly before Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. It’s unclear whether the shooting influenced people’s views of Biden, but the small number of poll interviews completed after the shooting provided no early indication that his prospects improved.</p><p>Meanwhile, as Vice President Kamala Harris receives additional scrutiny amid the talk about whether Biden should bow out, the poll found that her favorability rating is similar to his — but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is slightly lower.</p><p>The poll provides some evidence that Black Democrats are among Biden’s strongest supporters, with roughly half in the survey saying he should continue running, compared to about 3 in 10 white and Hispanic Democrats. Overall, seven in 10 Americans think Biden should drop out, with Democrats only slightly less likely than Republicans and independents to say that he should make way for a new nominee.</p><p>“I do have genuine concerns about his ability to hold the office,” said Democrat Andrew Holcomb, 27, of Denver. “I think he’s frankly just too old for the job.”</p><p>Janie Stapleton, a 50-year-old lifelong Democrat from Walls, Mississippi, held the opposite view, saying Biden is the “best candidate” for president.</p><p>People aren\\'t just sour on Biden on as they size up their choices this election season.</p><p>About 6 in 10 Americans want Trump to withdraw -- but relatively few Republicans are in that camp.</p><p>As for Biden, younger Democrats are especially likely to want to see him bow out – and to say they’re dissatisfied with him. Three-quarters of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden to drop out, compared to about 6 in 10 of those who are older.</p><p>“I just feel like these two individuals are a sad choice,” said Alexi Mitchell, 35, a civil servant who lives in Virginia. She identifies as a Democratic-leaning independent, and while she thinks Biden is probably still mentally up to the job, she worries that the past few weeks\\' unraveling of support makes him a weak candidate, no matter what happens next. “If he doesn\\'t have control over his own party, that\\'s a fatal flaw,\" she said. \"He\\'s put us in a bad position where Trump might win.”</p><p>Despite bullish talk from the Biden campaign heading into the debate, the faceoff only left the president in a deeper hole. Democrats are slightly more likely to say they’re dissatisfied with Biden as their nominee now than they were before his halting performance. About half are dissatisfied, an uptick from about 4 in 10 in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/the-biden-trump-debate-is-seen-as-important-for-their-campaigns/\">an AP-NORC poll from June</url>.</p><p>By contrast, most Republicans – about 6 in 10 – came out of the debate very or somewhat satisfied with Trump as their candidate. Too few interviews were conducted after the assassination attempt to provide a clear indication of whether Republicans or Americans overall have rallied further around Trump since then.</p><p>David Parrott, a Democrat from Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, was willing to give Biden the benefit of the doubt given the president’s age, but he still voiced concerns about a potential second term.</p><p>“I don’t know if he can make it another four years or not,” said Parrott, a 58-year-old retiree. “Shouldn’t he be sitting at his beach house taking it easy?”</p><p>All of the recent churn has left Americans much more likely to think Trump is capable of winning the 2024 election than is Biden – 42% to 18%. About a quarter thought the the two men equally capable of winning.</p><p>Even Democrats are relatively dour about their party’s prospects come November.</p><p>Only about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable of winning than is Trump. About 3 in 10 think the two are equally capable of winning and 16% say victory is more likely to go to the Republican. By contrast, Republicans are overwhelmingly convinced that Trump is in the best position to win.</p><p>Trump also has the edge on Biden when Americans consider who is most capable of handling a crisis, 38% to 28%. And people are about equally divided on which candidate has the better vision for the country, with 35% saying Biden and 34% Trump.</p><p>For all of the disenchantment Biden is up against, the president insists it\\'s not too late to turn things around, saying past presidents have come back from a deficit at this stage in the campaign. In an <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/live/rnc-trump-biden-election-updates#00000190-be25-debe-aff0-fee78e760000\">interview Tuesday with BET News</url>, he said many voters haven\\'t focused yet, adding, “The point is, we\\'re just getting down to gametime right now.”</p><p>The poll did also offer a bright spot for Biden: 40% of adults say he’s more honest than Trump, while about 2 in 10 think the opposite.</p><p>Most Democrats — around 6 in 10 — say that Vice President Harris would make a good president, while 22% think not and 2 in 10 don\\'t know enough to say. The poll showed that 43% of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of her, while 48% have an unfavorable opinion. Somewhat more have a negative view of Biden: approximately 6 in 10 Americans.</p><p>The survey was conducted before Trump selected freshman <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/jd-vance\">Sen. JD Vance of Ohio</url> as his running mate. It showed that for most Americans, Vance is still an unknown. Six in 10 don\\'t know enough about him to form an opinion, while 17% have a favorable view and 22% view him negatively.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-59eebaca6989985c2bfbf4f72bdfa11220240717</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CH3-6RR1-JC5B-G3JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><timeReceived>3:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 17, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kennedy Jr., recent polls show, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-trump-address-path-forward-e25e70090bba36db07cb8d7d4a4d00d7\">allies of Donald Trump urge the independent presidential candidate</url> to drop out and endorse the former Republican president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kennedy\\'s support appears to have declined in recent polls as he struggles to find his political lane in a race reshaped by the departure of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris\\' nomination in his place. The developments have left relatively narrow room for Kennedy\\'s presence — or potential departure — to make a difference in the election outcome. Recent polls don’t give a clear indication that Kennedy\\'s presence in the race has an outsized impact on support for either major-party candidate.</p><p>While some polls earlier in the year put Kennedy’s support in the double digits, support now hovers in <url normalizedValue=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-poll-election-issues/story?id=112865487\">the mid-single digits</url> in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/\">most recent polls</url>. It’s unclear if Kennedy would get even that level of support in the general election, since third-party candidates frequently <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-biden-trump-third-party-2024-election-71ffff6d34b0bad8b92cb8e82369d2e8\">don’t live up to their early poll numbers</url> when voters actually cast their ballots.</p><p>Kennedy is scheduled to speak in Phoenix on Friday “about the present historical moment and his path forward,” just days after his running mate openly discussed the possibility that he could drop out and endorse Trump.</p><h>Partisan appeal</h><p>In recent months, Americans overall have been split in their views of Kennedy, 70, the son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.</p><p>About as many people had a favorable as unfavorable view of Kennedy, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-2024-W1-topline.pdf\">July AP-NORC poll</url> that was conducted before Biden dropped out of the presidential race last month. That marks a decline from February, when more had a positive than negative view of Kennedy, and about 3 in 10 did not have an opinion.</p><p>In the most recent poll, about 2 in 10 U.S. adults didn’t know enough about Kennedy to give an opinion.</p><p>Republicans were significantly more likely than Democrats and independents to have a favorable view of Kennedy. And those with a positive impression of Kennedy were more likely to also have a favorable view of Trump (52%) than Harris (37%).</p><p>Kennedy also struggled to endear himself to political independents. Although he is running as an independent presidential candidate, polling shows about 4 in 10 independents did not know enough to form an opinion. Those who did were divided equally between favorable and unfavorable opinions.</p><h>The base of support</h><p>Kennedy\\'s appeal largely rested on being an alternative to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-immigration-economy-inflation-abortion-21b95914866c2af3a1e7af8e302dbe27\">match-up many Americans dreaded</url> when Biden was facing Trump in a rematch of the 2020 election won by Biden. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/07/PP_2024.7.29_ukraine_REPORT.pdf#page=20\">Pew Research Center poll from July</url> found that about half of voters who were supporting Kennedy said the main reason they backed him was because he was neither Biden nor Trump, compared with about 3 in 10 who listed Kennedy\\'s characteristics or policies.</p><p>Harris’ move to the top of the Democratic ticket may have further harmed Kennedy’s prospects. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/\">August Pew poll</url> suggested that Harris has gained support at Kennedy’s expense. She appears to have received the support of some women and non-white voters who previously were considering Kennedy.</p><h>About that family name</h><p>Kennedy’s initial appeal was largely focused on his family name and his relation to other famed Kennedys, including his father and his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23825119/cnn-poll-2024-democratic-primary.pdf#page=12\">CNN polling conducted last summer</url> when RFK Jr. was running for the Democratic nomination found that many Democrats said they’d consider supporting him because of the Kennedy name or his family connections. Many members of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-kennedy-rfk-trump-pennsylvania-b411e744d3b13fc6365029cb3dfd00c4\">Kennedy family endorsed Biden</url> before he withdrew from the race.</p><p>John F.

But neither was thrilled with the idea of a rematch of the 2020 election between two men who were then already a combined 150 years old.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">“I was kind of hoping something would change,” Saracco said of watching Biden, now 81, age over his three-plus years in office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then it did.</p><p>“It’s a fresh choice now,” said Valone, explaining her willingness to give Vice President <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/kamala-harris\">Kamala Harris</url>, now the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/ap-dnc-delegate-survey/\">likely Democratic nominee</url>, a chance after Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-drops-out-2024-election-ddffde72838370032bdcff946cfc2ce6\">ended his reelection bid</url>.</p><p>Valone, Saracco and Brock reflect what had come to define the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\">2024 presidential campaign</url>: The wide swath of voters who were disillusioned or dissatisfied with having to choose between the same two men who waged a bitter national fight four years ago.</p><p>Now, those voters, especially those who lean left, are expressing a renewed interest in the campaign and are eager to see Harris take on the Democratic Party mantle in place of Biden.</p><p>“I don’t know enough about her yet but I look forward to learning more,” Brock said. “And it’s certainly exciting to think about a woman and a woman of color\" being in a position to win.</p><p>Harris’ campaign is trying to reap the benefits, capitalizing on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-volunteers-2024-campaign-cef723e29a2ef11c293f07906b550fcd\">jolt of fundraising, volunteer interest and media attention</url> after Democrats spent the three weeks since Biden’s debate debacle wondering whether the octogenarian president would <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-drop-out-election-2024-3f9e3d15431fd4974771a54e1d0e4ea7\">stand down</url> or stick to his campaign even as his support within the party dwindled.</p><h>A rematch about being less disliked</h><p>For months, Biden\\'s campaign had placed an all-in bet that voters frustrated with or in denial about their options this fall would come around to his candidacy because of their shared fear of Trump. It was a risky proposition, evidenced by the swiftness of the collapse of Biden\\'s candidacy after the June 27 debate.</p><p>Now, with Harris in the driver\\'s seat, the same team that had prepared for a campaign of attrition is going on offense, seeing an “expanded universe of winnable voters,” as campaign chair Jen O\\'Malley Dillion wrote in a recent memo.</p><p>Where Biden and Trump were universally known and widely disliked, voters know less about the vice president.</p><p>The campaign and its Democratic allies <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/democratic-national-convention-harris-biden-changes-55e7f5cc9abf26f7d2586ed1dd129f49\">plan to reintroduce Harris</url> to the American people in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention next month and are looking to excite voters about their new choice.</p><p>The fresh start for Democrats does not eliminate the presence of “double haters” — those voters with negative impressions of both candidates. But it resets the race and gives Harris an opening to introduce herself to a range of voters, especially those who still hold strong reservations about Trump.</p><p>There are a range of emotions and opinions among disenchanted voters: While true double haters might have had genuinely unfavorable opinions about both candidates, others might have had a clear ideological lean toward one or the other, but a single stumbling block.</p><p>For Saracco, it was Biden\\'s age, a concern that was validated by his debate performance.</p><p>“President Biden has done an admirable job. I’ve been pleased with his administration,\" he said. “But the debate was the breaking point.”</p><h>Disenchantment simmered for a while</h><p>Americans’ unhappiness with the possibility of a Biden-Trump rematch has been clear for some time. Only one year into Biden’s presidency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-inflation-6b6b0abfef867fc405e9f358ce2c3a09\">an Associated Press-NORC poll found</url> that 7 in 10 Americans, including about half of Democrats, did not want him to run for reelection. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/jan2022_Biden_topline-1.pdf\">same poll, conducted in January 2022</url>, also found that about 7 in 10 Americans did not want Trump to run for president again.</p><p>By this point, broad dissatisfaction with Biden’s performance as president had started to set in. Only about 4 in 10 Americans approved of the way he was handling his job as president, according to the January 2022 poll, a drop of nearly 20 percentage points from the year before.</p><p>Biden’s honeymoon glow was not completely gone -- about half of Americans had a favorable opinion of him -- but his favorability rating continued to fall over the months that followed.</p><p>By the end of 2023, when it was becoming clear that a Biden-Trump rematch was a very real possibility, more than half of Americans said they would be somewhat or very dissatisfied if Biden or Trump was nominated.</p><p>But Trump retained the enthusiasm of many Republicans as the primaries wrapped up, while Biden lost ground with his own party’s base. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-2024-W1-topline.pdf\">July AP-NORC poll</url> conducted just before Biden withdrew from the race found that while about 6 in 10 Republicans were satisfied with Trump as the nominee, only about 4 in 10 Democrats said the same about Biden. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-poll-drop-out-debate-democrats-59eebaca6989985c2bfbf4f72bdfa112\">Nearly two-thirds of Democrats</url> in that poll said Biden should drop out.</p><p>Even left-leaning voters interviewed by the AP echoed broader frustrations over a two-party system that was poised to deliver a rematch.</p><p>“The United States has a jillion people, and for the candidates to be a former president and another president the ages that they are?” Valone asked in an incredulous tone. “I know why Republicans nominated Trump, because they\\'ve just handed their party over to him. But how could Democrats not see this coming, not see this was going to be an election that people just could not get excited about.”</p><h>Opportunities, risk for Harris and Trump</h><p>It\\'s unclear whether the new dynamic is permanent, but recent polls suggest the events of the past two weeks may have at least temporarily blunted the dynamics of the Biden-Trump rematch. Polls from CNN and from the New York Times and Siena College show that at least slightly fewer voters now hold an unfavorable view of both candidates.</p><p>That’s driven mostly by the fact that both polls show fewer have an unfavorable opinion of Harris than said the same of Biden, though both polls also suggest a slight uptick in the percentage saying they have a favorable view of Trump.</p><p>Republicans believe they can blunt any shift in public opinion with a barrage of advertising defining Harris as an extension of Biden’s record, especially on consumer prices and immigration, while also damaging her personal brand. Harris and her allies have an opportunity for a counteroffensive.</p><p>“This race is more fluid now -– the Vice President is well-known but less well-known than both Trump and President Biden, particularly among Dem-leaning constituencies,” O\\'Malley Dillon wrote.</p><p>Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, a lead consultant for Republican Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, said “double haters will still be in play in November.” But, he added, “There’s no question that voters know President Trump much better than Vice President Harris,” meaning unfavorable opinions about her may not be as calcified.</p><p>GOP pollster Whit Ayres said true independent “double haters” could still go either way, depending on the campaigns\\' messages.</p><p>“If Trump goes down the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-attacks-johnson-hudson-76f8e90d24004e49449087787ac031a5\">DEI road</url> of some of the far right-wingers, he’ll drive women into her arms,” Ayres said, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. “If he concentrates on her far-left San Francisco issue positions, he’ll drive them back to the double-hater category.”</p><p>Kathryn Kabat, a 69-year-old North Carolina voter who described herself as a Democratic-leaning independent, has already made her choice. The retired Air Force captain said she had planned to vote for Biden and mostly held to that intention even after his debate performance.</p><p>“I was sad for him, and I was worried he was going to lose and we would have another Trump term that we simply cannot afford,” she said.</p><p>Now, she’s not only a certain Harris voter but a volunteer.</p><p>“I’m sending postcards from home, and I\\'ll do whatever else I can,” she said. “So maybe I can add a few votes.”</p><p>___</p><p>Barrow reported from Atlanta.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-ad48e81f84af1ffec6cd0a2be4cfb43420240728</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CKD-9N21-JC5B-G1NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1336\"/><timeReceived>11:43 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 28, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

People had a more positive assessment of Biden than Trump in 24 countries, while Trump led in Hungary and Tunisia and the two men were effectively tied in eight other countries.</p><p>The greater confidence in Biden comes as faith in U.S. democracy is waning. While a median of 54% in the 34 countries polled have positive views of the U.S., a median of 4 in 10 across the surveyed nations told the pollsters that its democracy used to be a good example for other countries to follow but no longer is.</p><p>A median of 21% said U.S. democracy remains a good example for other nations, while an almost identical share, 22%, said it never has been. Since the spring of 2021, the only other time Pew asked the question, the share of those who believe U.S. democracy is a good example has fallen in eight countries, mostly in Europe.</p><p>“People just don\\'t see the U.S. political system as functioning very well,” said Richard Wike, director of global attitudes research for Pew. “People see the U.S. as really divided along partisan lines.”</p><p>There is far less of a global divide between Trump and Biden. Confidence in the current president to do the right thing in world affairs has dropped since his first year in office but remains well above that of his rival, who had relatively low global ratings during his own presidency. Biden\\'s lowest confidence ratings were over his handling of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\">Israel-Hamas war</url>, with a median of 57% saying they had no confidence in it.</p><p>A median of 39% in the surveyed countries said they approved of Biden\\'s handling of the war in Ukraine, with his highest ratings in European nations. And a median of about four in 10 were confident in his handling of China.</p><p>Of the five leaders rated in the survey, French President Emmanuel Macron registered the highest level of confidence, just ahead of Biden, while Russian President Vladimir Putin received the lowest.</p><p>While confidence in Biden has dwindled in countries ranging from South Africa to Israel to the U.K., it remains steadily higher than that in Trump. The former president received his poorest assessments in Europe — where those expressing no confidence in him included more than eight in 10 adults in France, Germany and Sweden — and Latin America.</p><p>Africa, which Wike said tends to have positive views of U.S. presidents, registered some of Trump\\'s best numbers. Even in the two countries where more confidence was expressed in Trump than Biden, they were down on the former president. In Tunisia, for example, only 17% expressed confidence in him.</p><p>Hungary is the other country where adults report higher confidence in Trump than Biden, but even there it\\'s far from a ringing endorsement. Trump has <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-orban-hungary-conservatives-autocrats-biden-97d6998f747d3543f2f1df069b0f9165\">embraced</url>Hungary and its autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, but only 37% in Hungary say they\\'re confident in him, compared to 24% for Biden.</p><p>The median level of confidence in Trump\\'s ability to do the right thing in world affairs was only slightly higher across the 34 countries than it was for Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-1c547bee39eb7ee926e1d5b1f38c998720240611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C7D-8681-DYMD-61FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><timeReceived>3:16 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 11, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It\\'s also home to a massive power plant in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-general-news-7d43588567fe04e1234222870e61ac41\">Colstrip, Montana</url>, that emits more toxic air pollutants such as lead and arsenic than any other U.S. facility of its kind, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>The EPA last month finalized a suite of rules that could force the Colstrip Generating Station to shut down or spend an estimated $400 million to clean up its emissions within the next several years. Another proposal, from the U.S. Interior Department, would <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/coal-leases-biden-powder-river-basin-b143ce4b8c3b6883fce4e603230f159b\">end new leasing</url> of taxpayer-owned coal reserves in the Powder River Basin, clouding the future of mines including Westmoreland Mining’s Rosebud Mine that provides about 6 million tons of fuel annually for Colstrip.</p><p>Eight years ago during his first White House run, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/9e1d087bc9d14dba9a91120d78bfef88\">Donald Trump</url> stoked populist anger against government regulation by highlighting anti-coal measures taken under former President Barack Obama. The latest moves against coal have teed up the issue again for Republicans seeking to unseat Biden in the November election. Some coal-state Democrats also raised concerns.</p><p>“This onslaught of new rules is going to kill jobs and will kill communities like Colstrip,” Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said during a visit to Rosebud Mine this week with Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte. “What will change this outcome is an election and a new administration.\"</p><p>U.S. coal consumption <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/domestic-news-domestic-news-general-news-7d43588567fe04e1234222870e61ac41\">dropped precipitously</url> over the past decade as cheap natural gas and renewables expanded. Yet coal\\'s political potency endures as detractors try to further curb burning of the fuel that\\'s a major contributor to climate change and air pollution.</p><p>It remains an economic mainstay in communities such as Colstrip, generating jobs where workers can earn $100,000 annually, according to union officials.</p><p>The Biden administration defended the latest restrictions on coal as necessary to reduce harmful pollutants, improve public health and address court rulings over climate change.</p><p>A Biden campaign representative noted that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/b79a51d2445c46a9af201cb342c7ec67\">coal\\'s decline continued</url> during Trump\\'s presidency.</p><p>“There is no war on coal, there is only a fight for our energy future,” campaign spokesperson James Singer said. \"Under President Biden, the United States is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades.”</p><p>Even with the ban on new coal leases, companies already hold leases on more than 4 billion tons of coal on taxpayer-owned lands. And administration officials say that\\'s enough to sustain mining for decades.</p><p>Supporters said the crackdown on pollution from coal plants was long overdue. Its origins trace to 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act that directed the EPA to set standards for pollution reduction technologies.</p><p>Dr. Robert Merchant, a pulmonologist from Billings, Montana, said research data is clear that pollution from Colstrip and other plants is linked to medical problems including cancers, developmental delays in children and heart attacks.</p><p>“The problem with Colstrip or any large industry like that is they’re very good at understanding the economics as it impacts their balance sheets and bottom line,\" Merchant said. \"Unfortunately, the health effects are not appearing on their bottom line.”</p><p>Representatives of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe had urged the Biden administration to adopt the pollution rules to protect air quality on their reservation just south of Colstrip.</p><p>The plant opened in the mid-1970s and was later expanded. It towers over Colstrip, a town of about 2,000 people. It\\'s linked to the Rosebud Mine by miles of conveyor belts that transport a steady supply of coal to the 1,480 megawatt plant, where it is burned to generate electricity for distribution across the state.</p><p>Brian Bird, president of Colstrip co-owner NorthWestern Energy, said the characterization of Colstrip by EPA Administrator Michael Regan during <url normalizedValue=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/events/hearings/budget-hearing-fiscal-year-2025-request-environmental-protection-agency\">Congressional hearings</url> as the “highest emitter in the country\" was deceptive because of the plant\\'s size — one of the largest coal plants west of the Mississippi River. Bird said Colstrip was “in the middle of the pack” in terms of the amount of pollution per megawatt of power generated.</p><p>Some Democrats said federal agencies were moving too fast and too aggressively against coal.</p><p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester said the EPA rules “missed the mark” since it could cost hundreds of millions of dollars for Colstrip to come into compliance. In West Virginia — the second largest coal producer behind Wyoming — Sen. Joe Manchin accused Biden of trying to “score short-term political points” by issuing the new rules in an election year.</p><p>Manchin announced Friday that he was <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-manchin-congress-west-virginia-senate-a4eb66f2cb773f822b6b607945cdeaef\">leaving the Democratic party</url> and registering as an independent, citing the “partisan extremism\" of the two major political parties.</p><p>Tester is considered <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/tester-senate-montana-2024-election-197d50f3aef99d35148e775acff52ed9\">one of the most vulnerable Democrats</url> in the Senate heading into the election, with Republicans needing to pick up just two seats to retake control of the chamber.</p><p>His Republican challenger, Tim Sheehy, railed against the “Biden Tester climate cult\" following announcement of the ban on new coal leases. Tester spokesperson Eli Cousin said the lawmaker was still reviewing the administration\\'s proposal.</p><p>Manchin is not seeking reelection when his term ends in January. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/west-virginia-governor-basketball-coach-jim-justice-9611b57f373ad092220eae7c1c881248\">Republican Gov. Jim Justice</url> is running for the seat, and the EPA rules could help push voters into his corner as he faces Democrat Glenn Elliott, the mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia.</p><p>Elliott has advocated for more green energy in West Virginia but hasn’t commented on the EPA rules.</p><p>EPA officials pledged to work with the Colstrip plant\\'s owners “to help them find a path forward” in response to concerns from by Tester and other lawmakers. Agency officials said 93% of coal-fired plants had shown they could comply with the new air pollution standards.</p><p>“We gave plants the maximum amount of time to comply with the standards we are allowed to under the Clean Air Act — three years plus the possibility of a one-year extension,” EPA spokesperson Shayla Powell said in a statement.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Matthew Daly in Washington and Leah Willingham in Charleston, West Virginia, contributed to this story.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-ee1f29220a09498051852fecbe475db620240531</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C50-W0V1-JC5B-G3MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>11:18 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 31, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Two Democratic lawmakers have called on Biden to exit the race while a leading ally publicly suggested how the party might <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-replacement-democratic-ballot-dnc-rules-7aa836b0ae642a68eec86cc0bebd3772\">choose someone else</url>. And senior aides said they believed he might only have a matter of days to show he was up to the challenge before anxiety in the party boils over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">“Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running \\\\u2026 no one’s pushing me out,\" Biden said on a call with staffers from his reelection campaign. \"I’m not leaving. I’m in this race to the end and we’re going to win.”</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, despite his efforts to pull multiple levers — whether it was his impromptu appearance with campaign aides, private conversations with senior lawmakers, a weekend blitz of travel and a network television interview — to salvage his faltering reelection, Biden was confronting serious and mounting indications that support for him was rapidly eroding on Capitol Hill and among other allies.</p><p>Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., told The New York Times that though he backs Biden as long as he is a candidate, this “is an opportunity to look elsewhere” and what Biden \"needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat — and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.”</p><p>Senior aides said they believe the 81-year-old Biden has just a matter of days to mount a convincing display of his fitness for office before his party’s panic over his debate performance and anger about his response boils over, according to two people with knowledge who insisted on anonymity to more freely discuss The president accepts the urgency of the task — having reviewed the polling and mountains of media coverage — but he is convinced he can do that in the coming days and insistent that he will not step out of the race, the aides said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a major Democratic donor, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, also called on the president to exit the race, saying, “Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous.” The statement was first reported by The New York Times.</p><p>And all that followed Rep. Jim Clyburn, a longtime Biden friend and confidant, saying he\\'d back a “mini-primary” in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention next month if Biden were to leave the race. The South Carolina Democrat floated an idea that appeared to be laying the groundwork for alternative choices by delegates during the Democrats’ planned virtual roll call that is scheduled before the more formal party convention set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.</p><p>On CNN, Clyburn said <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e\">Vice President Kamala Harris</url>, governors and others could join the competition: “It would be fair to everybody.”</p><p>Clyburn, a senior lawmaker who is a former member of his party\\'s House leadership team, said he has not personally seen the president act as he did on the debate stage last week and called it “concerning.”</p><p>And even as other Democratic allies have remained quiet since Thursday’s debate, there is a growing private frustration about the Biden campaign’s response to his disastrous debate performance at a crucial moment in the campaign — particularly in Biden waiting several days to do direct damage control with senior members of his own party.</p><p>One Democratic aide said the lacking response has been worse than the debate performance itself, saying lawmakers who support Biden want to see him directly combatting the concerns about his stamina in front of reporters and voters. The aide was granted anonymity to candidly discuss interparty dynamics.</p><p>Most Democratic lawmakers are taking a wait-and-see approach with Biden, though, holding out for a better idea of how the situation plays out through new polling and Biden’s scheduled ABC News interview, according to Democratic lawmakers who requested anonymity to speak bluntly about the president.</p><p>When Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who called on Biden to leave the race this week, shopped around his move for support from other Democratic lawmakers, he had no takers and eventually issued a statement on his own, according to a person familiar with the effort granted anonymity to discuss it.</p><p>But there was also a sense that the waiting period will soon expire if Biden does not step up his outreach to Capitol Hill or prove otherwise that he’s up to the job.</p><p>Some suggested Harris was emerging as the favorite to replace Biden if he were to withdraw, although those involved in private discussions acknowledge that Govs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gavin-newsom\">Gavin Newsom</url> of California and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gretchen-whitmer\">Gretchen Whitmer</url> of Michigan remain viable alternatives. But for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the best prospect to quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.</p><p>Even as pressure around Biden mounted, he and Harris made a surprise appearance on an all-staff reelection campaign call and offered a pep talk. They stressed how important it was to beat former President Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, in November and returned to Biden’s previous post-debate vow that when he gets knocked down, he gets up again.</p><p>“Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we’re going to beat him again in 2024,” said Biden, who told participants that he would not be dragged out of the race. Harris added: “We will not back down. We will follow our president’s lead. We will fight, and we will win.”</p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters whether Biden would consider stepping down. “Absolutely not,” she said.</p><p>“I cannot lay out something that would change the president’s mind,\" Jean-Pierre said about Biden continuing to seek a second term. She added that he “is clear-eyed. And he is staying in the race.”</p><p>Still, Democrats are unsatisfied with the explanations of Biden’s debate performance, from both White House staff and the president himself. And there is a deeper frustration among some in the party who feel that Biden should have handled questions about his stumbling debate performance much sooner and that he has put them in a difficult position by staying in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\">the race</url>.</p><p>The Leadership Now Project, a group of business executives, academics and thought leaders, said in a letter that the “threat of a second Trump term” is great enough that Biden should “pass the torch of this year’s presidential nomination to the next generation of highly capable Democrats.”</p><p>Trump’s campaign issued a statement noting that “every Democrat” now calling on the president “to quit was once a supporter of Biden.”</p><p>Trump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after last week\\'s debate. One poll, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html\">conducted by SSRS for CNN</url>, found that three-quarters of voters — including more than half of Democratic voters — said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.</p><p>About 7 in 10 voters, and 45% of Democrats, said Biden’s physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him, according to the CNN/SSRS poll.</p><p>And about 6 in 10 voters, including about one-quarter of Democrats, said reelecting Biden would be a risky choice for the country rather than a safe one, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html\">a New York Times/Siena College poll</url>. That poll found that Democrats were split on whether Biden should remain the nominee.</p><p>Biden campaign pollster Molly Murphy said \"today’s polling doesn’t fundamentally change the course of the race.\"</p><p>In a further effort to boost morale, Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients urged White House aides during an all-staff meeting to tune out the “noise” and focus on the task of governing.</p><p>Biden himself began making personal outreach on his own, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-democrats-congress-election-aa619e71e1e09868abe22d19fc48e351\">speaking privately with senior Democratic lawmakers</url> such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons and Clyburn.</p><p>Among the Democratic governors who were planning to attend in person were Tim Walz of Minnesota, who leads the Democratic Governors Association, Newsom, Whitmer, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Daniel McKee of Rhode Island, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, John Carney of Delaware and Wes Moore of Maryland, according to their aides. Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Jay Inslee of Washington, Jared Polis of Colorado, Tina Kotek of Oregon and Phil Murphy of New Jersey were planning on attending virtually. Harris will also attend the session with governors.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Zeke Miller, Colleen Long, Josh Boak and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-7794155c12bc78c084e4b964545e2b7f20240703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CD3-W6R1-JC5B-G0DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><timeReceived>11:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 3, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Chris Coons, D-Del., who spoke with Biden on Tuesday, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “He wanted advice. He was asking earnestly for input and comment on what he should do to restore confidence and support, and what\\'s the best path forward.”</p><p>Coons, the president\\'s closest ally on Capitol Hill, said Biden clearly understood the urgency, the difficulty and the importance of the election, as the senator advised that the president do more unscripted, open-ended events to restore confidence in his candidacy. The two also spoke about Biden\\'s schedule and its impact on his political efforts, particularly as he balances that task with critical governing tasks such as the NATO summit in Washington next week.</p><p>Biden\\'s efforts to pull multiple levers to salvage his faltering reelection include his impromptu appearance with campaign aides, private conversations with senior lawmakers, a weekend blitz of travel and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-abc-televisiion-debate-1d33bf51fe706e2fd1adea7a83bbf617\">network television interview</url>.

The president accepts the urgency of the task — having reviewed the polling and mountains of media coverage — but he is convinced he can do that in the coming days and insistent that he will not step out of the race, they said.</p><p>Biden met for more than hour at the White House on Wednesday night, in person and virtually, with more than 20 Democratic governors who afterward described the conversation as “candid” but said they were standing behind Biden despite being concerned about a Trump victory in November.</p><p>“The president is our nominee.

Lloyd Doggett, who called on Biden to leave the race this week, shopped around his move for support from other Democratic lawmakers, he had no takers and eventually issued a statement on his own, according to a person familiar with the effort granted anonymity to discuss it.</p><p>But there was also a sense that the waiting period will soon expire if Biden does not step up his outreach to Capitol Hill or prove otherwise that he’s up to the job.</p><p>Some suggested Harris was emerging as the favorite to replace Biden if he were to withdraw, although those involved in private discussions acknowledge that Govs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gavin-newsom\">Gavin Newsom</url> of California and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gretchen-whitmer\">Gretchen Whitmer</url> of Michigan remain viable alternatives. But for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the best prospect to quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.</p><p>Even as pressure around Biden mounted, he and Harris made a surprise appearance on an all-staff reelection campaign call and offered a pep talk. They stressed how important it was to beat Trump, the presumptive nominee, in November and returned to Biden’s previous post-debate vow that when he gets knocked down, he gets up again.</p><p>“Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we’re going to beat him again in 2024,” said Biden, who told participants that he would not be dragged out of the race. Harris added: “We will not back down. We will follow our president’s lead. We will fight, and we will win.”</p><p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked during her briefing with reporters whether Biden would consider stepping down. “Absolutely not,” she said.</p><p>“I cannot lay out something that would change the president’s mind,\" Jean-Pierre said about Biden continuing to seek a second term.</p><p>Still, Democrats are unsatisfied with the explanations of Biden’s debate performance, from both White House staff and the president himself. And there is a deeper frustration among some in the party who feel that Biden should have handled questions about his stumbling debate performance much sooner and that he has put them in a difficult position by staying in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\">the race</url>.</p><p>The Leadership Now Project, a group of business executives, academics and thought leaders, said in a letter that the “threat of a second Trump term” is great enough that Biden should “pass the torch of this year’s presidential nomination to the next generation of highly capable Democrats.”</p><p>Trump’s campaign issued a statement noting that “every Democrat” now calling on the president “to quit was once a supporter of Biden.”</p><p>Trump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after last week\\'s debate. One poll, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html\">conducted by SSRS for CNN</url>, found that three-quarters of voters — including more than half of Democratic voters — said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.</p><p>About 7 in 10 voters, and 45% of Democrats, said Biden’s physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him, according to the CNN/SSRS poll.</p><p>And about 6 in 10 voters, including about one-quarter of Democrats, said reelecting Biden would be a risky choice for the country rather than a safe one, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html\">a New York Times/Siena College poll</url>. That poll found that Democrats were split on whether Biden should remain the nominee.</p><p>Biden campaign pollster Molly Murphy said \"today’s polling doesn’t fundamentally change the course of the race.\"</p><p>In a further effort to boost morale, Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients urged White House aides during an all-staff meeting to tune out the “noise” and focus on the task of governing.</p><p>Biden himself began making personal outreach on his own, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-democrats-congress-election-aa619e71e1e09868abe22d19fc48e351\">speaking privately with senior Democratic lawmakers</url> such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Coons and Clyburn.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick, Zeke Miller, Colleen Long, Josh Boak and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-7794155c12bc78c084e4b964545e2b7f20240704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CD7-5PH1-JC5B-G180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1641\"/><timeReceived>3:24 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 4, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Industry groups warned it could lead to the loss of manufacturing jobs and even shut down power plants or refineries. Business groups and Republican-led states are likely to challenge the rule in court.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the rule would have $46 billion in net health benefits by 2032, including prevention of up to 800,000 asthma attacks and 4,500 premature deaths. He said the rule will especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as people in low-income and minority communities adversely affected by decades of industrial pollution.</p><p>The rule “really does represent what the Biden-Harris administration is all about, which is understanding that healthy people equal a healthy economy,\\'\\' he told reporters Tuesday. “We do not have to sacrifice people to have a prosperous and booming economy.\\'\\'</p><p>The rule sets maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-epa-tightens-standards-for-soot-pollution-2012dec14-story.html\">a decade ago under the Obama administration.</url></p><p>The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires. The rule comes as Democratic President Joe Biden seeks reelection, and some Democrats have warned that a tough soot standard could harm his chances in key industrial states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>Administration officials brushed aside those concerns, saying the industry has used technical improvements to meet previous soot standards and can adapt to meet the new standard as well. Soot pollution has declined by 42% since 2000, even as the U.S. gross domestic product has increased by 52%, Regan said.</p><p>\"So we’ve heard this argument before, but the facts are well-established that these standards really will increase the quality of life for so many people, especially those who are disproportionately impacted,\\'\\' he said.</p><p>Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the EPA was “putting public health first by requiring polluters to cut soot from the air we all breathe.\\'\\'</p><p>Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, said that opponents\\' \"resistance is a stark reminder that the fight for clean air and a healthier future is far from over.\\'\\'</p><p>The new rule does not impose pollution controls on specific industries; instead, it lowers the annual standard for fine particulate matter for overall air quality. The EPA will use air sampling to identify counties and other areas that do not meet the new standard. States would then have 18 months to develop compliance plans for those areas. States that do not meet the new standard by 2032 could face penalties, although EPA said it expects that 99% of U.S. counties will be able to meet the revised annual standard by 2032.</p><p>Industry groups and Republican officials dispute that and say a limit of 9 micrograms per cubic meter could sharply increase the number of U.S. counties in violation of the soot standard. Companies in those places would have difficulty obtaining permits to build or expand industrial plants.</p><p>The American Forest and Paper Association called the new rule “unworkable” and said it undermines Biden’s promise to increase manufacturing jobs in the U.S.</p><p>“We are very concerned that many of the modernization projects in the paper and wood products industry and across U.S. manufacturing will no longer be able to move forward,\\'\\' said Heidi Brock, the group\\'s president and CEO.</p><p>The paper lobby was among 71 industry groups that warned the White House in a letter that a lower soot standard could force companies to locate new facilities in foreign countries with weaker air-quality standards, thereby undermining Biden\\'s economic and environmental goals.</p><p>EPA’s new rule could put hundreds of U.S. counties out of compliance and push many others close to the limit, “which threatens economic growth,\\'\\' said Marty Durbin, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"Compliance with the new standard will be very difficult,\\'\\' he said.</p><p>The standard for particle pollution, more commonly known as soot, was set in late 2012 under Democratic President Barack Obama and left unchanged by Republican President Donald Trump, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/epa-overrides-scientists-calls-for-tougher-pollutant-limit-2a4954da5a3d8e1cdd4a7e4ae20bd1b5\">who overrode a scientific recommendation for a lower standard</url> in his final days in office.</p><p>EPA scientists have estimated exposure at current limits causes the early deaths of thousands of Americans annually from heart disease and lung cancer, along with other health problems.</p><p>The new EPA rule would require states, counties and tribal governments to meet a stricter air quality standard for fine particulate matter up to 2.5 microns in diameter — far smaller than a human hair. The standard would not force polluters to shut down, but the EPA and state regulators could use it as the basis for other rules that target specific sources such as diesel-fueled trucks, refineries and power plants.</p><p>EPA said it will work with states, counties and tribes to account for and respond to wildfires, an increasing source of soot pollution, especially in the West. The agency allows states and air agencies to request exemptions from air-quality standards due to ”exceptional events,\\'\\' including wildfires and prescribed fires.</p><p>Paul Billings, a senior vice president at the American Lung Association, pushed back on industry claims that the rule would drive large numbers of counties out of compliance and hamper economic growth.</p><p>He accused the industry of using “cherry-picked data\\'\\' and misleading maps to make “false claims of economic calamity\\'\\' caused by the new rule. “Despite what polluting industries are saying, the sky will not fall and the world will not come to an end,\\'\\' Billings said.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lung.org/research/sota\">2023 lung association report</url> found that nearly 64 million Americans live in counties that experience unhealthy daily spikes in soot pollution and nearly 19 million live in counties that exceed annual limits for soot pollution. People of color were nearly four times as likely as white people to live in a county with multiple failing grades on air quality, the report said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d48a02362129ecda5be4d44dbd3442ed20240207</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8R-K1R1-JC5B-G0TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><timeReceived>9:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 7, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They described her as a historic figure, the embodiment of hope, “the president of joy.”</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But amid the extraordinary optimism, former first lady Michelle Obama offered a sober warning: “No matter how good we feel tonight or tomorrow or the next day, this is going to be an uphill battle.”</p><p>The word of caution was quickly drowned out by the excitement that overwhelmed the standing-room-only 17,000-person arena in downtown Chicago. But as activists, operatives and party leaders leave the Democratic National Convention and fan out across America, a stark reality exists: The real test for Harris has only just begun.</p><p>More than a month after President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed her, Harris has barely started to outline detailed plans she would pursue as president to address the nation’s biggest challenges — immigration, crime and climate change, among them. She has yet to sit down for even one comprehensive media interview to face difficult questions about her flip-flops on policy in recent years, her leadership style and the focus on race and gender that looms over her historic candidacy.</p><p>“We can’t put our heads in the sand. She’s a Black woman. The bar is going to be higher for everything,” said John Anzalone, a pollster who has served the last three Democratic presidential nominees. “And guess what? That means, even mistakes. Mistakes are going to be magnified.”</p><p>At the same time, Harris’ allies acknowledge she remains largely undefined in the minds of many voters, having operated in Biden’s shadow for much the last four years. The relative anonymity offers both opportunity and risk.</p><p>“The bad thing about vice presidents is that nobody knows who you are. The good thing about vice presidents is nobody knows who you are,” said David Axelrod, who served as former President Barack Obama’s chief strategist.</p><p>Harris now has just over two weeks to prepare for what could be her only presidential debate against Trump, a Sept. 10 showdown that could dramatically shift the direction of the race. The first presidential debate, of course, effectively forced Biden to drop out of the race.</p><p>For now, Harris’ team feels no urgency to roll out a comprehensive policy platform or sit for media interviews that might jeopardize the positive vibes that have defined her nascent campaign and produced a flood of campaign donations and a growing army of swing-state volunteers.</p><p>During a series of meetings throughout the convention week, her advisers cast her policy agenda as a continuation and expansion on Biden’s first term achievements, particularly on economic matters, even if it may look and sound different in some cases.</p><p>Harris has notably dropped her opposition to fracking and her support for Medicare for All, which were defining features of her 2019 presidential campaign. Her aides insist her values remain the same, but she’s embraced more centrist policies out of pragmatism.</p><p>Meanwhile, Harris’ allies believe it’s only a matter of time before Trump settles on an effective line of attack.</p><p>In recent days, the Republican former president has adopted a kitchen-sink approach against Harris that includes attacks about her racial identity, her laugh, her record as vice president and her history as a “San Francisco liberal.”</p><p>“He’ll figure out how to get a message and land a political punch,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who delivered a prime-time convention speech this week, said of Trump.</p><p>Polling reveals that voters’ views of Harris have shifted relatively rapidly in the month since Biden stepped aside and she became the de facto nominee.</p><p>In a June AP-NORC poll, just 39% of Americans said they had a favorable opinion of Harris and 12% said they didn’t know enough to say.</p><p>After Biden stepped aside, an August AP-NORC poll found that 48% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Harris with just 6% saying they didn’t know enough to have an opinion. The latest poll also showed that 27% of adults have a “very” favorable opinion of Harris, up from 14% in June.</p><p>The sharp shift raises the possibility that public opinion could change again as voters learn more.</p><p>It also raises the possibility that Harris’ momentum has less to do with her candidacy than a sense of relief among Democrats that Biden stepped aside. Shortly before he left the race, an AP-NORC poll found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats said they didn’t want Biden to run again, and about half said they’d be dissatisfied if he was the nominee.</p><p>Young Democrats of America president Quentin Wathum-Ocama said his enthusiasm is based on a combination of relief that Biden stepped aside and excitement about Harris. Given her relatively low profile over the last four years, he conceded that even he does not know much about her governing plans.</p><p>As a public school teacher, he said he’d like to hear more about her education policy, for example.</p><p>“Do people know her? People are aware of her,” Wathum-Ocama said. “I can be excited, but I still want more.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP writers Josh Boak in Chicago and Michelle L.

The conversations at the doors in the final weeks left people worried rather than energized,” Wikler said. “That engine felt like it was sputtering. And now the engine is roaring.”</p><p>Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming said in a press conference Tuesday that Harris was experiencing “a little honeymoon.\"</p><p>“But I don’t think it’s going to last,\" he said.</p><p>Further, he said, Biden was suffering “clear across the state in every Democratic stronghold” to the point Democrats “had nowhere to go but up.”</p><p>According to interviews with more than a dozen Madison Democrats, Harris\\' attention to specific party priorities, in addition to her younger age and livelier style, have helped restore their enthusiasm.</p><p>Daniel Zaydman, 24, pointed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-kamala-harris-white-house-e86e6f95a0707e290384fcc86367e4fd\">Harris\\' March public call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war</url>, a conflict that has divided the Democratic base. Biden has also pushed for a cease-fire while continuing to back weapons shipments to Israel as it conducts a war in Gaza that has resulted in at least 39,000 Palestinian deaths.</p><p>“She had come out against the genocide in Gaza, not just in recent days but months ago,\" said the former state legislative aide, who noted that he is Jewish. “At the time, I was like, wow, the vice president is ahead of the president on this.</p><p>“She had been in Biden\\'s shadow, and no one my age group liked his position on Gaza,\" he said. “And that has been a huge sticking point with voters in my age group.”</p><p>For Sam Heesacker, Harris is noticeably more vocal and convincing in her advocacy of abortion rights, a top priority for the 28-year-old University of Wisconsin graduate student in education curriculum. Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-abortion-debate-f5e7b3cd543fef2ab7b1359737c592c0\">struggled during his debate</url> with Trump to complete an answer about the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a national right to abortion. Trump nominated three of the justices who voted to overturn Roe.</p><p>“She\\'s more progressive than Biden, calling it what it is: Reproductive freedom,” she said, taking a break from studying at a coffee shop on Madison\\'s bustling State Street.</p><p>Shea Head felt a new sense of optimism, noting Harris’ visibility supporting the priorities of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>The 59-year-old education researcher said from a corner seat in a west-side cafe that she had read last spring where Harris had spoken about the 20-year anniversary of same-sex marriages being performed in California. Head recalled Harris’ more public profile on the issues after seeing the candidate make a voter registration plug on “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” last week.</p><p>“She was on talking about gay rights and trans rights. Obviously, she knows in that situation she’s speaking to a population that knows our rights are in danger,” Head said. “She’s speaking to me in a way that Biden wasn’t, or maybe couldn’t as convincingly.”</p><p>The observations reflect broader enthusiasm toward Harris among Democrats nationally.</p><p>An AP-NORC poll conducted after Biden withdrew from the race found that about 8 in 10 Democrats would be <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-poll-drop-out-debate-democrats-59eebaca6989985c2bfbf4f72bdfa112\">somewhat or very satisfied</url> if Harris became their party\\'s nominee. That\\'s a big change from another AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden dropped out, which found that only 37% of Democrats were very or somewhat satisfied that he was the Democratic Party’s likely nominee for president.</p><p>Strategists in both parties point to other college towns in swing states that they think Harris will invigorate younger adults and traditional liberals. In Michigan, there’s Ingham County, home of Michigan State University and the Democratic-heavy capital city of Lansing, and Washtenaw County, home of the University of Michigan. Biden won them with 65% and 72% of the vote respectively enroute to carrying Michigan by fewer than 3 percentage points in 2020.</p><p>Though he lost North Carolina by fewer than 2 percentage points, Biden won 67% of the vote in Wake County, a booming hub around the capital Raleigh and the region’s Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina.</p><p>Anzalone, Biden\\'s former pollster, said there had been fear within the party before Biden decided not to run that there was going to be a universe including younger voters who might not vote or consider going to third-party candidates.</p><p>“I was worried even loyal Democratic voters might feel apathetic about their choices,\" 38-year-old Leah Kechele, a nursing instructor, said between Zoom meetings at a popular Madison cafe. “I think she can fire them up.”</p><p>___</p><p>This story has been corrected to show the county’s name is Ingham, not Ingraham.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press polling editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP\\'s coverage of the 2024 election at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\">https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-1b055fa6268d937015c5feaf0079cf6020240731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CM1-0SF1-DYMD-64K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1048\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 31, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Arizona Sen. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mark-kelly\">Mark Kelly</url> stands out as one with more name recognition and higher favorability, particularly among Democrats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The survey, which was conducted after President Joe Biden announced he was withdrawing from the race and Harris became <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-biden-presidential-candidate-election-withdraw-9fbd153493cb3f088994854fe61a73e9\">the likely Democratic presidential nominee</url>, highlights the strengths and weaknesses that different politicians could bring to the ticket — and the challenges they could face if selected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kelly, while better known and liked than some of the alternatives, is still unfamiliar to about half of Americans. And others, like Pennsylvania Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/josh-shapiro\">Josh Shapiro</url>, while less known nationally, could draw on a deeper well of support in their home states and regions. Kelly and Shapiro are viewed among the front-runners, according to people familiar with the process, after the Harris campaign began its vetting with about a dozen names.</p><p>Harris said Tuesday she had not yet decided on her No. 2. But she, and whomever she selects, will head out on a seven-state swing of key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, next week.</p><h>Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly</h><p>Of the four potential Democratic vice-presidential candidates included in the poll – Kelly, Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/andy-beshear\">Andy Beshear</url> and North Carolina Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/roy-cooper\">Roy Cooper</url>, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-cooper-vice-president-vetting-9ff2a5abf9f4191e5ccb2d52e57b06a3\">publicly removed himself</url> from consideration after the poll was fielded — Kelly has the highest name recognition and favorability, according to the AP-NORC poll.</p><p>Americans are more likely to have a positive view of Kelly than a negative view. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a very or somewhat favorable view of Kelly, while about 2 in 10 have a negative view. Drawing more good feelings than bad is a relative rarity in presidential politics these days: Biden and former President Donald Trump have been viewed more negatively than positively for several years now.</p><p>Like many of the other contenders, though, Kelly is nowhere near a household name. About half of Americans don’t know enough to have an opinion about him.</p><p>But Democrats are especially likely to have warm feelings about Kelly. Forty-five percent have a favorable view of Kelly. Only about 1 in 10 have an unfavorable view of him, and around 4 in 10 don’t know enough to say. Older Democrats — those 45 and older — are especially likely to have a positive view of Kelly, while younger Democrats are more likely to be unfamiliar with him.</p><p>He’s proven to be a battle-tested campaigner, winning a special election in 2020 to flip the Arizona Senate seat from Republican control and then retaining it two years later for a full, six-year term. The Navy veteran is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and has been an influential voice among Democrats on immigration and border security, long a political vulnerability for Harris that Republicans are seeking to exploit.</p><h>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro</h><p>Shapiro is broadly unknown to Americans and Democrats, except in the Northeast, where he has more name recognition and higher favorability. The poll found that 6 in 10 U.S. adults — including 57% of Democrats — don\\'t know enough to have an opinion about Shapiro. About 2 in 10 Americans view him favorably, and a similar share view him unfavorably.</p><p>The picture isn\\'t very different among Democrats. About one-quarter of Democrats have a positive view of Shapiro, while 16% have a negative view. Older Democrats are more likely than younger ones to have a favorable opinion of Shapiro, but overall, most have yet to develop a view.</p><p>Shapiro was elected governor in 2022, defeating Republican Doug Mastriano — a controversial figure who drew opposition and criticism from members of his own party, including then-GOP Sen. Pat Toomey.</p><p>Unlike the other contenders asked about in the AP-NORC poll, though, he’s significantly better known — and liked — in his home region. In the Northeast, 4 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him. Another 4 in 10, roughly, don’t know enough to have an opinion of him, while about 2 in 10 Northeasterners view him negatively.</p><p>Democrat Gary Hines, a 68-year-old in Philadelphia, had high praise for his home-state governor and added: “I’d hate to see him leave, because he’s just getting started in Pennsylvania.”</p><h>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear</h><p>If chosen, Beshear would need to introduce himself to most of the country. Around 7 in 10 Americans don’t know enough to have an opinion about him. Those with a view are about evenly split: 17% of U.S. adults have a positive view, and 15% have a negative one.</p><p>However, Democrats have a more positive than negative opinion of Beshear. About one-quarter have a very or somewhat favorable view, while around 1 in 10 have a negative view. Nearly two-thirds don’t know enough about Beshear to give an opinion.</p><p>The scion of a well-known Democratic family in the state, Beshear defeated then-Gov. Matt Bevin — a deeply unpopular figure, even in conservative Kentucky — then won reelection in 2023 against Republican Daniel Cameron, a longtime protégé of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Beshear\\'s victory last year was credited in part to his advocacy of abortion rights, including a campaign ad that featured a sexual assault survivor attacking Cameron for his stances.</p><h>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz</h><p>Like the other governors who are being discussed, Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/timothy-walz\">Tim Walz</url> doesn’t have much of a national profile — and that also means he’s a relatively blank slate. He wasn’t included in the AP-NORC poll, but a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/democrats-are-supportive-of-harris-but-many-adults-think-trump-has-the-electoral-advantage/\">new ABC News/Ipsos poll</url>, which asked about favorability slightly differently, found that about 9 in 10 U.S. adults don’t know enough to have an opinion on him. Among Americans with a view, opinions are split between positive and negative.</p><p>Walz, who also served for 12 years in the House, moved up on Harris\\' shortlist in recent days after he coined “weird” as a new talking point to describe the Republican ticket. It\\'s a line now used widely by the vice president and other Democrats.</p><p>He currently leads the Democratic Governors Association.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.</p><p>___</p><p>AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow the AP\\'s coverage of the 2024 election at <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024\">https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d01c79817844b66c5bf466a1cd403c5020240801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CM7-00F1-DYMD-62GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><timeReceived>12:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 1, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They still see a tough contest looming, though: A majority of U.S. adults, 56%, say that if Trump and Harris are their parties’ nominees for the general election in November, Trump is more likely to win.</p><p>Lauren Schulman, a Democrat from Pompano Beach, Florida, said she admires Biden and what he has accomplished during his presidency. But she said with him at the top of the ticket, “I have just been so terrified that we were going to lose.”</p><p>With Harris, on the other hand, “she’s been a bright, shining star,” said Schulman, 66, noting that the vice president is “smart and she’s younger, and she even comes off younger than she is. That makes such a huge contrast with Trump.”</p><h>Growing enthusiasm for Harris — especially compared to Biden</h><p>About 7 in 10 Black adults and about half of Hispanic adults would be satisfied with Harris as the Democratic nominee — a marked increase from earlier in July, when about half of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults felt satisfied with Biden as the Democrats’ expected nominee. (The poll did not include enough Asian adults to analyze their responses separately.)</p><p>The share of younger adults (those under the age of 45) who say they would be satisfied with Harris as the nominee, at around 4 in 10, is higher than the 17% who said they were satisfied with Biden in July.</p><p>Bryan Seigler, a Democrat from Raleigh, North Carolina, praised Harris\\' “broad appeal” and pointed to a contrast that Democrats weren\\'t able to make before.</p><p>“Donald Trump is the old guy now,” said Seigler, 36.</p><p>The new poll shows that Harris\\' overall favorability has risen slightly, from 39% <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/americans-are-split-over-whether-trump-should-face-prison-in-the-hush-money-case-ap-norc-poll-finds/\">at the beginning of the summer</url> — before the debate — to 46% now. Democrats’ opinions of Harris have also shifted in a slightly more positive direction. Eight in 10 Democrats have a positive view of Harris, up slightly from around 7 in 10 in early June.</p><p>Harris <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-president-democrat-biden-96df4c46fab767269056511037776b15\">would be a historic candidate</url> — she would be the first woman to win the presidency, as well as the first Black woman, the first South Asian American, and the first Asian American. Around 4 in 10 Americans say that it would be a good thing for the country to elect either a woman or a person of color to be president. Even more — about 6 in 10 when asked about electing a person of color and about half when asked about electing a woman — say it does not matter.</p><p>Majorities of Democrats, however, say it would be good for the country to elect a woman or person of color.</p><h>Views of Biden’s decision</h><p>Most Americans, 54%, say they have heard or read a lot about Biden’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. About three-quarters of Americans approve of his decision to withdraw as the Democratic nominee for president, including most Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>For many Democrats, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-2024-lawmakers-debate-2c426f98063ab30143a7675cba10a5b4\">Biden’s catastrophic June 27 debate</url> showed that — even if they were largely satisfied with his accomplishments during his time in office — the incumbent president should not be running for a second term because of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-election-debate-trump-7c366fda83a697265d9ecc77e8a32fd1\">concerns about how his age</url> was affecting his public performance or his ability to campaign effectively against Trump.</p><p>“When I watched the debate, you could just tell his cognitive ability was hardly there,” said Julian Castañeda, a Democrat in Pocatello, Idaho. “He had a hard time forming sentences and a lot of his responses, I couldn’t even understand what he was saying. At his age right now, it was appropriate for him to stand aside.”</p><p>Biden\\'s choice to endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee for president is slightly more divisive, with about half of U.S. adults in support, though Democrats overwhelmingly approve. There are similar levels of support for Biden’s decision to serve out the rest of his presidential term.</p><p>Withdrawing from the race didn\\'t do much to change Americans\\' views of Biden overall. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of how Biden is handling his job as president. That number is roughly in line with where it has been for the last two years. Biden’s favorability ratings are similar to where they were before he dropped out of the race, with about 4 in 10 adults and about three-quarters of Democrats holding a positive view.</p><h>Americans see a tough election contest for Harris</h><p>Even as the new Harris campaign has reasons for optimism, the vice president faces an opponent who is better known by the country and who has a reputation for a loyal base of support.</p><p>Most Americans perceive Trump as having the advantage going into the November election. A majority of U.S. adults say that if Trump and Harris are the candidates, Trump is more likely to win. About 9 in 10 Republicans say Trump is more likely to become president, while only about 7 in 10 Democrats say that about Harris.</p><p>Schulman thinks Harris is more likely to win this fall. Still, she added: “Democrats, we’re like a real, nervous, paranoid bunch these days.\"</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

Boos and infighting marred Donald Trump\\'s first convention in 2016, but this one was defined by <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-republican-national-convention-immigration-d832fedbbd0df0a4fa68f941474c0209\">overwhelming displays of unity</url> as GOP leaders — Trump skeptics among them — reveled in what most view as an all but certain victory come November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump\\'s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-shooting-rally-a1bcbaa4a604e09be8cc22893751895b\">survival after nearly being assassinated</url> at a Pennsylvania rally over the weekend, they said, was the last piece to bring everyone together in spite of the former president\\'s extraordinary personal and political baggage.</p><p>“It feels like 1980,” said a smiling New York GOP Chair Ed Cox on the convention\\'s red-carpeted floor this week, referring to Ronald Reagan\\'s landslide presidential victory. Cox pointed to a sense of inevitability building around Trump and the GOP. “We finally came completely together.”</p><p>For Democrats, it is the worst of times.</p><p>Back in Washington, the party <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-drop-out-election-2024-3f9e3d15431fd4974771a54e1d0e4ea7\">intensified a public and private lobbying effort</url> to force President Joe Biden to drop out of the race after <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-president-trump-d5fb136a643edb020745336ff9709923\">his disastrous debate</url> against Trump last month. Donors, elected officials and leaders within Biden\\'s own campaign believe he cannot win. And an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll indicated that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-poll-drop-out-debate-democrats-59eebaca6989985c2bfbf4f72bdfa112\">the vast majority of Democratic voters</url> have lost confidence in Biden\\'s ability to govern and want him to step aside before it is too late to stop Trump.</p><p>Only about a third of Democrats believe Biden is more capable than Trump of winning in November, according to the poll, which also found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats say Biden should withdraw from the presidential race and let his party nominate a different candidate.</p><p>By contrast, about 7 in 10 Republicans say Trump is more capable of winning the election. Almost no Republicans think Biden is more capable of winning. The doubters include Black Democrats, who make up the backbone of Biden’s political coalition. Only about half of Black Democrats think Biden is better able to win, according to the poll.</p><p>Many Democrats now privately expect — or perhaps hope — that someone other than Biden will be on stage to accept the party’s nomination when <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/democratic-national-convention\">the Democratic National Convention</url> begins in Chicago in a month.</p><p>Hours before <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-republican-national-convention-nomination-assassination-attempt-5f1f337ac39477e9d1c53d3e027edda3\">Trump\\'s triumphant convention speech</url> on Thursday, a top Biden campaign official repeatedly pushed back against a flurry of new questions about whether the president is going to step aside.</p><p>\"I do not want to be rude, but I don’t know how many more times I can answer that,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy manager of Biden’s reelection campaign, told a news conference in Milwaukee when asked whether the president\\'s commitment to his reelection may be softening. “There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot.”</p><h>There\\'s still plenty of time for surprises</h><p>Election Day is 109 days away. The first early votes will be cast in just eight weeks. And recent elections suggest that the conventional wisdom is often wrong.</p><p>Some national polls do show a close race, though others suggest Trump with a lead. Some state polls have contained warning signs for Biden, too, including a recent New York Times/Siena poll that suggested a competitive race in Virginia, a state Republicans last won 20 years ago.</p><p>But history is littered with examples of stunning political upsets, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fb2e92a47f054019a2589ace78d20836\">Trump\\'s own 2016 election</url> against Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p><p>“Every time you start to get confident, pick up an article about Tom Dewey,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told a convention luncheon this week, referring to a Republican challenger who was favored against a struggling Democratic president in 1948.</p><p>“Tom Dewey was picking his Cabinet ... in mid-September because the election was over,” Gingrich said. “Republicans were totally confident. And Harry Truman won.”</p><p>Trump also enters the general election with huge liabilities.</p><p>He is the first major party nominee to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db\">found liable</url> of sexual abuse in a civil trial.

High prices and a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-ev-electric-vehicles-charging-stations-ohio-bdf7cc25e57a2ae8a0522aab434965fc\">lack of easy-to-find charging stations</url> are major sticking points, a new poll shows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they would be at least somewhat likely to buy an EV the next time they buy a car, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, while 46% say they are not too likely or not at all likely to purchase one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The poll results, which echo <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicles-biden-epa-poll-climate-change-32fd2232e6a053848ebfe7756fa21556\">an AP-NORC poll from last year</url>, show that <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a\">President Joe Biden’s election-year plan to dramatically raise EV sales</url> is running into resistance from American drivers. Only 13% of U.S. adults say they or someone in their household owns or leases a gas-hybrid car, and just 9% own or lease an electric vehicle.</p><p>Caleb Jud of Cincinnati said he’s considering an EV, but may end up with a plug-in hybrid — if he goes electric. While Cincinnati winters aren’t extremely cold, “the thought of getting stuck in the driveway with an EV that won’t run is worrisome, and I know it wouldn’t be an issue with a plug-in hybrid,\\\\u2033 he said. Freezing temperatures can slow chemical reactions in EV batteries, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicle-charging-tesla-frigid-temperatures-2c85e3455d49a86c12d1ba59a235cd4b\">depleting power and reducing driving range</url>.</p><p>A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency requires that about 56% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-environment-and-nature-economy-88fe6ca8e333f3d00f6d2e98c6652cea\">Auto companies are investing billions</url> in factories and battery technology in an effort to speed up the switch to EVs to cut pollution, fight climate change — and meet the deadline.</p><p>EVs are a key part of Biden’s climate agenda. Republicans led by presumptive nominee Donald Trump are turning it into <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-china-electric-vehicles-tax-credit-31e0eca67c6a3ae9ca5a773a1ade9447\">a campaign issue</url>.</p><p>Younger people are more open to eventually purchasing an EV than older adults. More than half of those under 45 say they are at least “somewhat” likely to consider an EV purchase. About 32% of those over 45 are somewhat likely to buy an EV, the poll shows.</p><p>But only 21% of U.S. adults say they are “very” or “extremely” likely to buy an EV for their next car, according to the poll, and 21% call it somewhat likely. Worries about cost are widespread, as are other practical concerns.</p><p>Range anxiety – the idea that EVs cannot go far enough on a single charge and may leave a driver stranded — continues to be a major reason why many Americans do not purchase electric vehicles.</p><p>About half of U.S. adults cite worries about range as a major reason not to buy an EV. About 4 in 10 say a major strike against EVs is that they take too long to charge or they don’t know of any public charging stations nearby.</p><p>Concern about range is leading some to consider gas-engine hybrids, which allow driving even when the battery runs out. Jud, a 33-year-old operations specialist and political independent, said a hybrid \"is more than enough for my about-town shopping, dropping my son off at school\\'\\' and other uses.</p><p>With EV prices declining, cost would not be a factor, Jud said — a minority view among those polled. Nearly 6 in 10 adults cite cost as a major reason why they would not purchase an EV.</p><p>Price is a bigger concern among older adults.</p><p>The average price for a new EV was $52,314 in February, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/kbb-atp-february-2024/\">Kelley Blue Book</url>. That\\'s down by 12.8% from a year earlier, but still higher than the average price for all new vehicles of $47,244, the report said.</p><p>Jose Valdez of San Antonio owns three EVs, including a new Mustang Mach-E. With a tax credit and other incentives, the sleek new car cost about $49,000, Valdez said. He thinks it\\'s well worth the money.</p><p>\"People think they cost an arm and a leg, but once they experience (driving) an EV, they\\'ll have a different mindset,\\'\\' said Valdez, a retired state maintenance worker.</p><p>The 45-year-old Republican said he does not believe in climate change. “I care more about saving green” dollars, he said, adding that he loves the EV\\'s quiet ride and the fact he doesn\\'t have to pay for gas or maintenance. EVs have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and generally cost less to maintain. Valdez installed his home charger himself for less than $700 and uses it for all three family cars, the Mustang and two older Ford hybrids.</p><p>With a recently purchased converter, he can also charge at a nearby Tesla supercharger station, Valdez said.</p><p>About half of those who say they live in rural areas cite lack of charging infrastructure as a major factor in not buying an EV, compared with 4 in 10 of those living in urban communities.</p><p>Daphne Boyd, of Ocala, Florida, has no interest in owning an EV. There are few public chargers near her rural home “and EVs don’t make any environmental sense,\\\\u2033 she said, citing precious metals that must be mined to make batteries, including in some countries that rely on child labor or other unsafe conditions. She also worries that heavy EV batteries increase wear-and-tear on tires and make the cars less efficient. Experts say extra battery weight can wear on tires but say proper maintenance and careful driving can extend tire life.</p><p>Boyd, a 54-year-old Republican and self-described farm wife, said EVs may eventually make economic and environmental sense, but “they’re not where they need to be” to convince her to buy one now or in the immediate future.</p><p>Ruth Mitchell, a novelist from Eureka Springs, Arkansas, loves her 2017 Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid that can go about 50 miles on battery power before the gas engine takes over. “It’s wonderful — quiet, great pickup, cheap to drive. I rave about it on Facebook,\\\\u2033 she said.</p><p>Mitchell, a 70-year-old Democrat, charges her car at home but says there are several public chargers near her house if needed. She’s not looking for a new car, Mitchell said, but when she does it will be electric: “I won\\'t drive anything else.\\'\\'</p><p>___</p><p>The AP-NORC poll of 6,265 adults was conducted March 26 to April 10, 2024 using a combined sample of interviews from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population, and interviews from opt-in online panels.

Kennedy Jr.</url> filed an election complaint Wednesday alleging CNN is colluding with Democratic President <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</url> and presumptive Republican nominee <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</url> to exclude him from a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8\">debate</url> the network is hosting next month.</p><p>Kennedy alleges the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-rfk-cnn-debate-ballot-access-biden-trump-d3c5466a9a307ea4480508160f660a55\">requirements to participate</url> in the June 27 debate were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and Kennedy claims he is being held to a higher standard.</p><p>“CNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden committee and the Trump committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions,” a lawyer for Kennedy, Lorenzo Holloway, wrote in a letter to the Federal Election Commission.</p><p>CNN said the complaint was without merit.</p><p>Biden and Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8\">agreed</url> this month to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades. The first debate will come before Biden and Trump have been formally nominated by their parties this summer.</p><p>Kennedy has looked to the debates as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-rfk-cnn-debate-ballot-access-biden-trump-d3c5466a9a307ea4480508160f660a55\">singular opportunity</url> to stand alongside Biden and Trump, lending legitimacy to his <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153\">longshot bid</url> and convince people inclined to support him that he has a shot at winning. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns fear he could play spoiler.</p><p>Kennedy still has time to meet the requirements, though the window is narrowing.</p><p>CNN has said candidates will be invited if they have secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency, and have reached 15% in four reliable polls by June 20.</p><p>Kennedy\\'s campaign says he has submitted signatures or other paperwork to appear on the ballot in nine states — California, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah — with a combined 171 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.</p><p>“The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning,” a CNN spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. “As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state.\"</p><p>Kennedy also hasn\\'t met the polling criteria, the statement said.</p><p>Biden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won\\'t be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-1f08f1af8a5201fe78725bd883634dc820240529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4N-3BB1-DYMD-63MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"467\"/><timeReceived>5:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 29, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Polling from throughout Biden’s time in office reveals a widespread sense of disappointment with Biden’s performance as president, even among some of his most stalwart supporters, including Black adults. That’s a sign that his winning coalition may be fraying and that as a result, Biden will need to work to build enthusiasm about his candidacy within his own base as well as among the moderates who helped propel him to victory in 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump, who has perennially struggled to broaden his appeal beyond his base, won his party’s nomination with limited support from moderates and independents. That shortcoming wasn’t an issue for the conservative GOP primary electorate, but it could turn into a bigger problem as Trump looks to November when those voters could play a pivotal role in deciding the election.</p><h>Some of Biden’s most important groups are unhappy with his performance as president</h><p>The Democratic coalition that sent Biden to the White House came in with high hopes about his presidency — which may have been a double-edged sword. AP-NORC polling shows that three years after Biden took office, the share of U.S. adults who approve of the way he’s handling his job as president has fallen more than 20 percentage points, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/president-bidens-honeymoon-period/\">from 61% in early 2021</url> to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/many-are-concerned-about-bidens-mental-fitness-and-job-performance/\">38% last month</url>.</p><p>Nearly all Democrats, 97%, approved of Biden’s job performance in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/president-bidens-honeymoon-period/\">AP-NORC poll conducted in February 2021</url>. That’s down to 74% now, with even lower ratings when it comes to immigration and his handling of the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians. And it includes substantial erosion among some of Biden’s most important constituencies. Only about half of Black adults have approved of Biden’s job performance in recent months, down from 94% in early 2021 — a huge decline in satisfaction among a cornerstone of the Democratic coalition.</p><p>Biden’s approval rating has also fallen at least 20 percentage points among Hispanic adults, independents, young adults and moderates. According to last month’s AP-NORC poll, he’s now underwater among all four groups.</p><p>The economy has been a particular thorn in Biden’s side since 2022, when <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/key-inflation-report-highest-level-in-four-decades-c0248c5b5705cd1523d3dab3771983b4\">inflation hit a 40-year high</url>. Broad discontent over rising prices is reflected in Biden’s approval regarding the economy: Just 34% approve in the latest AP-NORC poll, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/February-2021-first-release-topline.pdf\">down from 55% in February 2021</url>. An <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-state-of-union-mental-capacity-trump-reelection-66d8784586d21f30885d8153f949510c\">AP-NORC poll released last month</url> found that 57% of U.S. adults think the national economy has gotten worse since Biden took office.</p><h>Trump showed weakness among moderates in the early primaries and caucuses</h><p>Although Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-republicans-nomination-delegates-61801649ea454f730bd193ca04ab739f\">won resoundingly in almost every state</url>, the conservative Republican primary electorate is very different from the broader array of voters Trump will be trying to win over in November.</p><p>Unlike Biden’s struggle with falling approval, Trump’s challenge as president was an approval rating that started low and stayed low, with the bulk of his support coming from his Republican base. His post-presidency favorability rating has been similarly sticky: 36% of U.S. adults had a favorable view of Trump in January 2021, which was essentially unchanged in the recent February poll. And despite Biden\\'s apparent weakness with Black and Hispanic adults, only about one-quarter of Black adults and about 4 in 10 Hispanic adults had a favorable view of Trump in February, which could make it harder for him to capitalize on those potential shortcomings.</p><p>There are serious risks for Trump if he can’t broaden his appeal beyond his Republican base this time around. He lost moderates to Biden in 2020, and the first head-to-head Republican contests showed continued signs of trouble for Trump among these voters.</p><p>According to VoteCast surveys of the 2024 Republican primaries in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/how-why-new-hampshire-voted-primary-election-6768e1ae04ce2b88d64773a9672d04d8\">New Hampshire</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/who-voted-how-south-carolina-primary-trump-haley-86a0c7960e5c3c7f88ec1c9a330be53e\">South Carolina</url>, Trump won only about 3 in 10 independents in each state. His support from moderate Republicans was a little higher but still notably tepid: Between 46% and 51% of this group backed him in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/iowa-caucus-who-voted-how-poll-votecast-4d1d5eb89b32fbba3afedee90334148c\">Iowa</url>, New Hampshire and South Carolina.</p><p>Those groups were more skeptical than conservative Republicans (who overwhelmingly supported Trump in all three states) about Trump’s ability to win a general election or govern as president. Roughly 6 in 10 moderate Republicans in New Hampshire and South Carolina were concerned that Trump is too extreme to win a general election, while 4 in 10 moderate Republicans in South Carolina said Trump doesn’t have the mental capability to govern effectively as president.</p><p>Trump could have his best chance with white, moderate voters without a college degree. Those voters represent one of Trump’s primary constituencies — but he split voters in this group who identify as moderates by a margin of 48% to 50% in the last election. Biden’s previous appeal to moderates of all backgrounds could cause problems for Trump.</p><p>A significant share of centrist Republicans have also indicated that they might not be willing to vote for Trump in the general election. Between 29% and 37% of Republican moderates in the early contests said they wouldn’t vote for Trump if he became the nominee.</p><p>But while moderates are a relatively small share of the GOP electorate, they are crucial in general elections. About one-third of voters in the 2020 election identified as moderates. About half of those moderate voters identify as Democrats, with about one-third being Republicans.</p><p>And Trump now has less than a year to win over a group of voters who were less inclined to support him in 2020. According to AP VoteCast surveys from 2020, 62% of moderate voters backed Biden, while only about one-third, or 36%, voted for Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-f80f8d7193e7901768b1bf67378c442a20240313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJ7-B791-DYMD-61F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><timeReceived>6:12 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 13, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The rules are a key part of President Joe Biden\\'s pledge to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-climate-change-science-climate-environment-and-nature-bdcf107d1fd146c2136f132b9fd13861\">eliminate carbon pollution from the electricity sector by 2035</url> and economy-wide by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rule was among four measures targeting coal and natural gas plants that the EPA said would provide “regulatory certainty” to the power industry and encourage them to make investments to transition “to a clean energy economy.” The measures include requirements to reduce toxic wastewater pollutants from coal-fired plants and to safely manage coal ash in unlined storage ponds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the rules will reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting the reliable, long-term supply of electricity that America needs.</p><p>“One of the biggest environmental challenges facing our nation is man-made pollution that damages our air, our water and our land,\" Regan said in a speech at Howard University. “Not only is this pollution a major threat to public health — it’s pushing our planet to the brink.\\'\\'</p><p>Regan called the power plant rules “a defining moment” for his agency as it works to \"build a cleaner and healthier future for all of us.\\'\\'</p><p>The plan is likely to be challenged by industry groups and Republican-leaning states. They have repeatedly accused the Democratic administration of overreach on environmental regulations and have warned of a looming reliability crisis for the electric grid. The rules issued Thursday are among at least a half-dozen EPA rules limiting power plant emissions and wastewater pollution.</p><p>Environmental groups hailed the EPA’s latest action as urgently needed to protect against the devastating harms of climate change.</p><p>The power plant rule marks the first time the federal government has restricted <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-emissions-global-warming-carbon-dioxide-coal-494ef490f16abe381ea2a4107f779670\">carbon dioxide emissions</url> from existing coal-fired power plants. The rule also would force future electric plants fueled by coal or gas to control up to 90% of their carbon pollution. The new standards will avoid 1.38 billion metric tons of carbon pollution through 2047, equivalent to the annual emissions of 328 million gas cars, the EPA said, and will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in climate and health benefits, measured in fewer premature deaths, asthma cases and lost work or school days.</p><p>Coal plants that plan to stay open beyond 2039 would have to cut or capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032, the EPA said. Plants that expect to retire by 2039 would face a less stringent standard but still would have to capture some emissions. Coal plants that are set to retire by 2032 would not be subject to the new rules.</p><p>Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said that through the latest rules, “the EPA is systematically dismantling the reliability of the U.S. electric grid.\\'\\'</p><p>He accused Biden, Regan and other officials of “ignoring our energy reality and forcing the closure of well-operating coal plants that repeatedly come to the rescue during times of peak demand. The repercussions of this reckless plan will be felt across the country by all Americans.”</p><p>Regan denied that the rules were aimed at shutting down the coal sector, but he acknowledged in proposing the power plant rule last year that, “We will see some coal retirements.”</p><p>The proposal relies on technologies to limit carbon pollution that the industry itself has said are viable and available, Regan said. “Multiple power companies have indicated that (carbon capture and storage) is a viable technology for the power sector today, and they are currently pursuing those CCS projects,\\'\\' he told reporters Wednesday.</p><p>Coal provided about 16% of U.S. electricity last year, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.</p><p>Dan Brouillette, president and CEO of of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies, said he was “disappointed\" that the EPA “did not address the concerns we raised about carbon capture and storage.\\'\\' While promising, the technology \"is not yet ready for full-scale, economy-wide deployment,\\'\\' said Brouillette, who served as energy secretary in President Donald Trump\\'s administration.</p><p>The rules initially included steps to curb emissions from existing natural gas plants, but Regan <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-power-plants-climate-change-natural-gas-coal-1499236035aa7c34dbec36a7144df25e\">delayed that aspect of the rules until at least next year</url> after some moderate Democrats and the gas industry warned that the plan could affect grid reliability. Regan also said he wanted to address complaints from environmental justice groups that the earlier plan allowed too much toxic air pollution from gas-fired plants near low-income and minority neighborhoods.</p><p>Even so, the rules issued Thursday complete \"a historic grand slam” of major actions by the Biden administration to reduce carbon pollution, said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The first and most important action was passage of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-congress-climate-and-environment-f084d23d61ebb068068d4aa92c82fdbb\">the 2022 climate law,</url> officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, followed by separate EPA rules targeting tailpipe emissions from <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a\">cars</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-trucks-buses-emissions-climate-electric-vehicle-77da206eed5d1950993e18a6f4439254\">trucks</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-methane-epa-climate-oil-gas-cop28-6d37e9da49944e9a8c0b08aeb3ddc73e\">methane emissions</url> from oil and gas drilling.</p><p>Together, the climate law and the suite of EPA rules “are the biggest reductions in carbon pollution we\\'ve ever made and will put the country on the pathway to zero out carbon emissions,\\'\\' Doniger said.</p><p>The nation still faces challenges in eliminating carbon from transportation, heavy industry and more, said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental group Earthjustice, \"but we can\\'t make progress on any of it without cleaning up the power plants.\\'\\'</p><p>Jim Matheson, CEO of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, called the EPA rule \"unlawful, unrealistic and unachievable,” adding that it faced a certain court challenge. The rule disregards the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision that limited the agency’s ability to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-us-supreme-court-pollution-air-clean-act-0996737f311647a8576640d3d2fdf58a\">regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act</url>, Matheson said.</p><p>“This barrage of new EPA rules ignores our nation’s ongoing electric reliability challenges and is the wrong approach at a critical time for our nation’s energy future,” said Matheson, whose association represents 900 local electric cooperatives across the country.</p><p>The EPA rules would not mandate use of equipment to capture and store carbon emissions — a technology that is expensive and still being developed. Instead, the agency would set caps on carbon dioxide pollution that plant operators would have to meet. Some natural gas plants could start blending gas with other fuel sources that do not emit carbon, although specific actions would be left to the industry.</p><p>Still, the regulation is expected to lead to greater use of carbon capture equipment. Only <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-science-business-louisiana-8e41ce52bcb66117ad97b58dffe3b607\">a handful of projects</url> are operating in the country despite years of research.</p><p>The EPA also tightened rules aimed at reducing wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants and preventing harm from toxic pits of coal ash, a waste byproduct of burning coal.</p><p>Coal ash contains cancer-causing substances like arsenic and mercury that can leach into the ground, drinking water and nearby rivers and streams, harming people and killing fish. The waste is commonly stored in ponds near power plants. The EPA issued rules in 2015 to regulate active and new ponds at operating facilities, seven years after <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-ms-state-wire-environment-health-a7c90c7577e74715b00a4e02d48afc96\">a disaster</url> in Kingston, Tennessee, that flooded two rivers with toxic waste and destroyed property.</p><p>Environmental groups challenged that rule, arguing it left a large amount of coal ash waste unregulated by the federal government. The rule issued Thursday forces owners to safely close inactive coal ash ponds and clean up contamination.</p><p>A separate rule will reduce toxic wastewater pollution by 660 million pounds annually, according to federal officials. It’s a reversal of the Republican Trump administration’s push to loosen coal plant wastewater standards.</p><p>The Biden rule comes nearly a decade after former President Barack Obama first tried to set limits on carbon pollution from U.S. power plants. His 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/98b898c2ea124bf0bc7eb12d1584d12f\">Clean Power Plan was blocked by the Supreme Court</url> and later rolled back by Trump.

Texas filed a separate suit, as did business groups led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers.</p><p>“The EPA’s new rule has more to do with advancing President (Joe) Biden’s radical green agenda than protecting Kentuckians’ health or the environment, said Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is leading <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/2024-03-06%20Petition%20for%20Review.pdf\">the joint lawsuit</url> along with West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.</p><p>The EPA rule “will drive jobs and investment out of Kentucky and overseas, leaving employers and hardworking families to pay the price,” Coleman said.</p><p>The soot rule is one of several EPA dictates under attack from industry groups and Republican-led states. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-epa-good-neighbor-air-pollution-rules-9d29c120d276f4bad5b3ea2c75d107ff\">Supreme Court heard arguments last month</url> on a GOP challenge to the agency\\'s “good neighbor rule,” which restricts smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas.</p><p>Three energy-producing states — Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia — challenged the rule, along with the steel industry and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges.</p><p>In opposing the soot rule, Republicans and industry groups say the United States already has some of the strictest air quality standards in the world — tougher than the European Union or major polluters such as China and India.</p><p>Tightening U.S. standards \"wouldn\\'t improve public health, but it would put as many as 30% of all U.S. counties out of compliance under federal law, leading to aggressive new permitting requirements that could effectively block new economic activity,\\'\\' Coleman said.</p><p>The EPA rule sets maximum levels of fine particle pollution — more commonly known as soot — at 9 micrograms per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-epa-tightens-standards-for-soot-pollution-2012dec14-story.html\">a decade ago under the Obama administration.</url></p><p>Environmental and public health groups hailed the rule as a major step to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/extreme-heat-wildfire-smoke-climate-california-0dd4cd818033dec79b9e6e99e94da73a\">improve the health of Americans</url>, including future generations. EPA scientists have estimated exposure at previous limits contributed to thousands of early deaths from heart disease and lung cancer, along with other health problems.</p><p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the new soot rule, finalized last month, would create $46 billion in net health benefits by 2032, including prevention of up to 800,000 asthma attacks and 4,500 premature deaths. The rule will especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, Regan said, as well as people in low-income and minority communities adversely affected by decades of industrial pollution.</p><p>\"We do not have to sacrifice people to have a prosperous and booming economy,\\\\u2033 Regan said.</p><p>Biden is seeking reelection, and some fellow Democrats have warned that a tough new soot standard could harm his chances in key industrial states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>The EPA and White House officials brushed aside those concerns, saying the industry has developed technical improvements to meet previous soot standards and can adapt to meet the new ones. Soot pollution has declined by 42% since 2000, even as the U.S. gross domestic product has increased by 52%, Regan said.</p><p>The new rule does not impose pollution controls on specific industries. Instead, it lowers the annual standard for fine particulate matter for overall air quality. The EPA will use air sampling to identify counties and other areas that do not meet the new standard. States would then have 18 months to develop compliance plans for those areas. States that do not meet the new standard by 2032 could face penalties, although EPA said it expects that 99% of U.S. counties will be able to meet the revised annual standard by 2032.</p><p>Industry groups and Republican officials dispute that and say a lower soot limit could put hundreds of U.S. counties out of compliance.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned the White House in January that 43% of total particulate emissions come from wildfires, and called the pollution standard \"the wrong tool to address this problem.\\'\\'</p><p>The EPA said it will work with states, counties and tribes to account for and respond to wildfires, an increasing source of soot pollution, especially in the West, where climate change has led to longer wildfire seasons, with more frequent and intense fires. The agency allows states and air agencies to request exemptions from air-quality standards due to “exceptional events,\" including wildfires and prescribed fires.</p><p>Besides Kentucky, West Virginia and Texas, other states challenging the EPA rule include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming.</p><p>All three cases were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-55aef43c4942e99a48db65d034a8837720240306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGS-0JS1-DYMD-6298-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><timeReceived>11:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 6, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The change came after complaints from environmental justice groups, who said the earlier plan allowed too much toxic air pollution which disproportionately harms low-income neighborhoods near power plants, refineries and other industrial sites.</p><p>“As EPA works towards final standards to cut climate pollution from existing coal and new gas-fired power plants later this spring, the agency is taking a new, comprehensive approach to cover the entire fleet of natural gas-fired turbines, as well as cover more pollutants,\\'\\' EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.</p><p>He called the new plan a “stronger, more durable approach” that will achieve greater emissions reductions than the current proposal. It also will better protect vulnerable frontline communities suffering from toxic air pollution caused by power plants and other industrial sites, Regan said.</p><p>Still, the plan was not universally welcomed by environmentalists, who the said the new approach will likely push rules for existing gas plants past the November presidential election.</p><p>“We are extremely disappointed in EPA’s decision to delay finalizing carbon pollution standards for existing gas plants, which make up a significant portion of carbon emissions in the power sector,\\'\\' said Frank Sturges, a lawyer for the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group.</p><p>“Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have gone uncontrolled for far too long, and we have no more time to waste,” he said.</p><p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, called EPA\\'s decision “inexplicable,\\'\\' adding: “Making a rule that applies only to coal, which is dying out on its own, and to new gas power plants that are not yet built, is not how we are going to reach climate safety.\\'\\'</p><p>But some environmentalists hailed the decision, saying the new plan would ultimately deliver better results.</p><p>“We have always known that the fight for a clean power sector wouldn’t be a quick one,\\'\\' said Charles Harper of Evergreen Action. \"EPA’s first order of business should be finalizing strong and necessary limits on climate pollution from new gas and existing coal plants as quickly as possible.\\'\\'</p><p>“We are glad that EPA is committed to finishing the job with a new rule that covers every gas plant operating in the U.S.,\\'\\' Harper added.</p><p>“Tackling dirty coal plants is one of the single most important moves the president and EPA can make to rein in climate pollution,\\'\\' said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice. \"As utilities propose new fossil gas plants, we absolutely have to get ahead of a big new pollution problem.”</p><p>EPA issued <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-climate-change-coal-gas-power-plants-809d38eff9b33d051a98541a4045f69d\">a proposed rule in May 2023</url> that called for drastically curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal and gas-fired plants, as well as future gas plants planned by the power industry. No new coal plant has opened in the U.S. in more than a decade, while dozens of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years in the face of competition from cheaper natural gas. The Biden administration has committed to create a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.</p><p>The EPA proposal could force power plants to capture smokestack emissions using a technology that has long been promised but is not used widely in the United States.</p><p>If finalized, the proposed regulation would mark the first time the federal government has restricted <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-emissions-global-warming-carbon-dioxide-coal-494ef490f16abe381ea2a4107f779670\">carbon dioxide emissions</url> from existing power plants, which generate about 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution, second only to the transportation sector. The rule also would apply to future electric plants and would avoid up to 617 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2042, equivalent to annual emissions of 137 million passenger vehicles, the EPA said.</p><p>Almost all coal plants — along with large, frequently used gas-fired plants — would have to cut or capture nearly all their carbon dioxide emissions by 2038, the EPA said. Plants that cannot meet the new standards would be forced to shutter.</p><p>Much of the EPA plan is expected to be made final this spring and is likely to be challenged by industry groups and Republican-leaning states. They have accused the Democratic administration of overreach on environmental regulations and warn of a pending reliability crisis for the electric grid. The power plant rule is one of at least a half-dozen EPA rules limiting power plant emissions and wastewater treatment.</p><p>The National Mining Association warned of \"an onslaught” of government regulation “designed to shut down the coal fleet prematurely\\\\u2033 when the EPA proposal was announced last year.</p><p>Regan has denied that the power plant rule is aimed at shutting down the coal sector, but acknowledged last year that, “ <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-climate-change-coal-gas-power-plants-809d38eff9b33d051a98541a4045f69d\">we will see some coal retirements.\\'\\'</url></p><p>Coal provided just over 16% of U.S. electricity in 2023, down from about 45% in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas provided about 43% of U.S. electricity.

JOHN</nameText></person></author><nitf:byttl>Associated Press</nitf:byttl></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After World War II, Black people in Houston found the rare chance to buy a nice home in the new community of Pleasantville, Texas. But in the years that followed, officials routed the Interstate 610 loop, with its tailpipe exhaust, along one side of Pleasantville and cement plants and other heavy industry grew nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just days after taking office in 2021, the Biden administration made huge promises to heavily polluted Black, Latino, Indigenous and lower income areas like this, known as environmental justice communities.</p><p>To evaluate how well Biden and his departments delivered on these promises, The Associated Press spoke to some 30 environmental justice groups around the country, people who have been trying for years and sometimes decades to get places near their homes cleaned up — Superfund sites, petrochemical plants and diesel-burning ports, for example.</p><p>Many said this administration has done more than any one has previously. With ambition not seen before, they said, federal officials have solicited their advice, written stricter environmental protections and committed tens of billions of dollars in funding.</p><p>“Once he was in office, he put money where his mouth was,” said Beverly Wright, who directs the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and sits on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. “I almost gasped when I saw the amount of money.”</p><p>But the local advocates interviewed have concerns, too. Some said <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-environment-868cf861ad9cddf67a6f7283312f8f13\">Biden administration policies have been too weak</url> to drastically reduce pollution and change their lives. Officials have even favored climate technologies that make conditions worse, they said.</p><p>Those advances could be reversed if the presidential election Nov. 5 brings in a Republican administration. Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump considers much of the regulation these groups favor to be overreach.</p><p>Pleasantville, near Houston’s petrochemical heartland, got a piece of Biden’s funds. Bridgette Murray, founder of the group Achieving Community Tasks Successfully, said residents wanted what many environmental justice groups want, data about what is in the air. Now a federal grant will help them do air testing, she said, and they can show those results to regulators.</p><p>It won’t actually clean the air, Murray said, “but if we don’t do anything, there will never be change.” Sustained funding will be necessary to accomplish that, she said.</p><p>The Texas grant is one of many. For each region of the country, the Environmental Protection Agency handed large amounts of money to an established group to dole out to local ones who know their communities’ needs. In Massachusetts, for example, Boston-based nonprofit Health Resources in Action got $50 million to do this.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-climate-health-tax-law-economy-inflation-f112d7c78abaa724d22964317d213deb\">Inflation Reduction Act</url> injected billions into Biden’s effort — for the first time making significant funds available for environmental justice. Officials have also <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/forever-chemicals-pfas-pollution-epa-drinking-water-1c8804288413a73bb7b99fc866c8fa51\">written regulations</url> they say will <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-air-pollution-soot-biden-wildfires-d48a02362129ecda5be4d44dbd3442ed\">drastically improve public health</url>.</p><p>But nearly all the interviews with environmental justice groups surfaced concerns, too.</p><p>Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which helps communities in a main petrochemical corridor, said the Biden administration listens to activists, invites them in for photo ops, but doesn’t enforce the law aggressively enough to keep the state’s Black population safe.</p><p>“When you have an EPA that basically won’t assert its authority, then a state like Louisiana that is wholly captured by industry can ignore the federal government. And that’s what they do,” Rolfes said.</p><p>EPA enforcement has increased under Biden, but Rolfes said federal officials still give the state too much power to ignore clean air rules.</p><p>Some local organizations have found it difficult to navigate the federal bureaucracy and apply for money despite technical assistance that’s available.</p><p>A big obstacle is time. Nearly four years in, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-biden-environment-power-plant-regulations-fec31a2f2198b776c5f24d2d9f66684b\">some Biden administration programs are just beginning to distribute money</url>. Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee for president, has backed President Biden’s environmental justice work, saying in December that he has “put equity at the center of all of our climate investments.” A spokesperson for the Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Some environmental advocates expressed frustration that the Biden administration backed the technology known as carbon capture, which promises to keep extra greenhouse gas emissions out of the air by pumping them underground. They said it allows industrial plants that pollute to continue doing so, or even expand. It is favored by heavy industries, and they can now receive substantial tax benefits for it.</p><p>Federal Chief Environmental Justice Officer Jalonne White-Newsome said when Congress passed the 2021 infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, they included incentives for carbon capture. The Biden administration had to carry out the law and has invited feedback.</p><p>She said the Biden administration has tried to embed environmental justice principles into the “fabric and foundation” of the federal government.</p><p>“We are not at the Promised Land yet,” she said, “but we are going there.”</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn’t matter.</p><p>The poll also shows the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/democracy-threats-biden-trump-2024-pennsylvania-176e42a3877eaf33160c71d1b73c96cd\">stakes of democracy</url> in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.</p><p>“Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn’t really land for me,” said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. “I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.”</p><p>He said he’ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he’s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-donald-trump-presidential-philadelphia-5d0f7c02df093f0d3a3340474a53be4b\">Biden</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-biden-democracy-election-2024-f2f824f056ae9f81f4e688fe590f41b4\">Trump</url> spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy.

They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars targeting voters who, in many cases, have just begun to pay attention to the election. And their campaigns will try to focus their messages on three familiar issues — the economy, immigration and abortion — even in the midst of heated debates over character, culture and democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The candidates <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-debate-abc-muted-microphones-election-03dc176ac8bbb47f9c18d4e84b109e04\">will debate in one week</url> in what will be their first meeting ever. The nation’s premier swing state, Pennsylvania, begins in-person absentee voting the week after. By the end of the month, early voting will be underway in at least four states with a dozen more to follow by mid-October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In just 63 days, the final votes will be cast to decide which one of them will lead the world’s most powerful nation.</p><p>Privately, at least, both camps acknowledge that victory is no sure thing as they begin the nine-week sprint to Election Day. Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in most national polls conducted since <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-drops-out-2024-election-ddffde72838370032bdcff946cfc2ce6\">President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign</url>.</p><p>The Harris campaign still put out a memo over the weekend casting itself as “the clear underdogs” in the contest.</p><p>“There’s not a scenario here that’s easy,” Harris senior adviser David Plouffe said in an interview. “The pathway to beating Donald Trump, the pathway to 270 electoral votes for Kamala Harris, is exceedingly hard, but doable. And that’s just a reality.”</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, rejects any indicators that suggest Harris is ahead even as he lashes out at her in deeply personal and sometimes apocalyptic terms, declaring that “our country is finished” if she wins.</p><p>“As we move past Labor Day, we will really get into the time where voters start to harden their opinions,” said James Blair, the Trump campaign\\'s political director. “We feel pretty good about things. We feel energized. Our people are energized. But there’s certainly plenty of work to be done.”</p><h>The electoral map settles on seven states</h><p>Just over a month ago, Trump allies suggested Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, Virginia or even New Jersey might be in play. Neither side believes that is still the case on Labor Day weekend.</p><p>In replacing Biden as the party\\'s nominee, Harris breathed new life into the Democrats’ political prospects, especially across the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. All four states have significant numbers of African Americans and Latinos, traditionally Democratic constituencies who were down nationally on Biden but appear to have come home to rally behind Harris.</p><p>South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham was among the senior GOP officials who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-governor-kemp-graham-04ebe25ef4780f5a192db6ad10237ced\">brokered a peace</url> between Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, whose feud threatened to undermine the Republican effort in the state. Graham told The Associated Press he was worried about Georgia\\'s shift leftward.</p><p>“Trump was up 5 or 6 points, and all over the course of a month it’s become much more competitive,” he said.</p><p>Republican pollster Paul Shumaker, an adviser to North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, said even a slight uptick in the Black vote has the potential to give Harris the edge in North Carolina, pointing to Mecklenburg County, the home of the Charlotte metro area, but also fast-growing counties such as Durham and Wake.</p><p>“If Kamala Harris could get them to turn out at the rate of Republicans in rural North Carolina, game over for Republicans,” Shumaker said of Black voters.</p><p>At the same time, Trump remains decidedly on offense in the Midwestern battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which form the so-called Democratic “blue wall” that he narrowly carried in 2016 and barely lost in 2020.</p><p>Those seven states — in addition to swing districts in Nebraska and Maine that each award single Electoral College votes — will draw virtually all of the candidates’ attention and resources over the next nine weeks.</p><p>Trump is investing more advertising dollars in Pennsylvania than any other state through Election Day.</p><p>A Trump victory in Pennsylvania alone would make it much more difficult for Harris to earn the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Harris\\' team insists she has multiple pathways to victory.</p><h>The Democrats’ organizing advantage</h><p>In the fight to frame the election on the air and reach voters in person, Democrats currently have a decided advantage.</p><p>Harris’ team is on pace to outspend Trump’s camp 2-to-1 in television advertising over the next two months. And even before Biden made way for Harris, the Democrats wielded superior campaign infrastructure in the states that matter most.</p><p>Harris’ team, which includes her campaign and an allied super PAC, have more than $280 million in television and radio reservations for the period between Tuesday and Election Day, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Trump’s team, by contrast, has $133 million reserved for the final stretch, although that number is expected to grow.</p><p>Trump’s side is actually narrowly outspending Harris’ on the airwaves in Pennsylvania, where both sides will spend more than $146 million between Tuesday and Election Day, according to AdImpact, a figure that dwarfs that of any other state. Georgia is drawing nearly $80 million in ad spending over the campaign’s final nine weeks.</p><p>But in the other five battleground states, Harris largely has the airwaves largely to herself — at least for now.</p><p>Trump and his allied super PACs have made only marginal ad reservations in Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada to date. Harris’ team, by comparison, is investing no less than $21 million in each of the five states, according to an AdImpact analysis.</p><p>Harris’ team also boasts more than 300 coordinated offices and 2,000 staff on the ground in swing states, according to her campaign’s weekend memo.</p><p>Blair, the Trump campaign’s political director, disputes that Democrats have as big an organizing advantage as those numbers make it seem. He pointed to outside allies that will organize for Trump are well-funded, including a new effort backed by billionaire Elon Musk.</p><p>Trump’s campaign on Tuesday said it also has more than 100 dedicated campaign offices in key states, which are backed by another 200 existing GOP offices dedicated to Republican victories this fall.</p><h>Here\\'s what the polls say</h><p>Both candidates are locked in close races across the seven top swing states. Democratic pollster John Anzalone said Harris “put the Democrats back in the game to where it’s kind of a toss-up.”</p><p>But now comes the hard part, Anzalone said.</p><p>“Post Labor Day, when the bell rings, there is a battle for a slim universe of — you can call them anything you want: persuasion voters, swing voters, independent voters — and it’s pretty small, and that’s where each side gets a billion dollars,\" Anzalone said.</p><p>Many independents appear to find both candidates unsatisfying, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-honesty-discipline-immigration-ap-poll-f025463df08beacbaa0c51e7bbb7eda7\">an AP-NORC poll conducted</url> in August.</p><p>For now, Harris also has a slight advantage on some key traits among independents, while she and Trump are about even on others.</p><p>For example, about 3 in 10 independents say that “honest” describes Harris better, while about 2 in 10 say it describes Trump better. About 3 in 10 also say that “committed to democracy” describes Harris better, while less than 2 in 10 say it describes Trump better.</p><p>The candidates were about equally likely to be perceived by independents as capable of winning the election, capable of handling a crisis, and “caring about people like you.”</p><h>Who is the ‘change candidate’?</h><p>The race may ultimately be decided by whichever candidate can most successfully be cast as the “change candidate” given that about 7 in 10 voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, based on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-joe-biden-kamala-harris-donald-trump-1feb5ed3c2e29623ce3cec3565b487cd\">an AP-NORC poll</url> conducted in late July after Biden withdrew from the race.</p><p>Trump was the face of change when he won the 2016 election. And even after serving in the White House for four years, he continues to energize millions of frustrated voters who embrace his brash leadership style and unwillingness to follow the traditional rules of politics.</p><p>Harris has been Biden\\'s vice president for nearly four years, yet the historic nature of her candidacy — she would be the first woman president — allows her to make a convincing case that she represents a new direction for the country, said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville.</p><p>Still, he\\'s worried about his party\\'s “severe underperformance” in the so-called “blue wall” states in recent elections.</p><p>“I’ll feel good after the election,\" Carville said. \"Let’s get the hay in the barn. There’s still a lot of hay out there in the field.”</p><p>___</p><p>Peoples reported from New York and Thomson-DeVeaux from Washington.

The change came after complaints from environmental justice groups, who said the earlier plan allowed too much toxic air pollution which disproportionately harms low-income neighborhoods near power plants, refineries and other industrial sites.</p><p>“As EPA works towards final standards to cut climate pollution from existing coal and new gas-fired power plants later this spring, the agency is taking a new, comprehensive approach to cover the entire fleet of natural gas-fired turbines, as well as cover more pollutants,\\'\\' EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.</p><p>He called the new plan a “stronger, more durable approach” that will achieve greater emissions reductions than the current proposal. It also will better protect vulnerable frontline communities suffering from toxic air pollution caused by power plants and other industrial sites, Regan said.</p><p>Still, the plan was not universally welcomed by environmentalists, who the said the new approach will likely push rules for existing gas plants past the November presidential election.</p><p>“We are extremely disappointed in EPA’s decision to delay finalizing carbon pollution standards for existing gas plants, which make up a significant portion of carbon emissions in the power sector,\\'\\' said Frank Sturges, a lawyer for the Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group.</p><p>“Greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have gone uncontrolled for far too long, and we have no more time to waste,” he said.</p><p>Other environmental groups hailed the decision, saying the new plan would ultimately deliver better results.</p><p>“We have always known that the fight for a clean power sector wouldn’t be a quick one.,\\'\\' said Charles Harper of Evergreen Action. \"EPA’s first order of business should be finalizing strong and necessary limits on climate pollution from new gas and existing coal plants as quickly as possible.\\'\\'</p><p>“We are glad that EPA is committed to finishing the job with a new rule that covers every gas plant operating in the U.S.,\\'\\' Harper added.</p><p>“Tackling dirty coal plants is one of the single most important moves the president and EPA can make to rein in climate pollution,\\'\\' said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice. \"As utilities propose new fossil gas plants, we absolutely have to get ahead of a big new pollution problem.”</p><p>EPA issued <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-climate-change-coal-gas-power-plants-809d38eff9b33d051a98541a4045f69d\">a proposed rule in May 2023</url> that called for drastically curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal and gas-fired plants, as well as future gas plants planned by the power industry. No new coal plant has opened in the U.S. in more than a decade, while dozens of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years in the face of competition from cheaper natural gas. The Biden administration has committed to create a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035.</p><p>The EPA proposal could force power plants to capture smokestack emissions using a technology that has long been promised but is not used widely in the United States.</p><p>If finalized, the proposed regulation would mark the first time the federal government has restricted <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-emissions-global-warming-carbon-dioxide-coal-494ef490f16abe381ea2a4107f779670\">carbon dioxide emissions</url> from existing power plants, which generate about 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution, second only to the transportation sector. The rule also would apply to future electric plants and would avoid up to 617 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2042, equivalent to annual emissions of 137 million passenger vehicles, the EPA said.</p><p>Almost all coal plants — along with large, frequently used gas-fired plants — would have to cut or capture nearly all their carbon dioxide emissions by 2038, the EPA said. Plants that cannot meet the new standards would be forced to shutter.</p><p>Much of the EPA plan is expected to be made final this spring and is likely to be challenged by industry groups and Republican-leaning states. They have accused the Democratic administration of overreach on environmental regulations and warn of a pending reliability crisis for the electric grid. The power plant rule is one of at least a half-dozen EPA rules limiting power plant emissions and wastewater treatment.</p><p>The National Mining Association warned of \"an onslaught” of government regulation “designed to shut down the coal fleet prematurely\\\\u2033 when the EPA proposal was announced last year.</p><p>Regan has denied that the power plant rule is aimed at shutting down the coal sector, but acknowledged last year that, “ <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-climate-change-coal-gas-power-plants-809d38eff9b33d051a98541a4045f69d\">we will see some coal retirements</url>.”</p><p>Coal provides about 20% of U.S. electricity, down from about 45% in 2010. Natural gas provides about 40% of U.S. electricity. The remainder comes from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.</p><p>Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York-based group, said she was pleased that the concerns of environmental justice communities will be factored into EPA\\'s rulemaking.</p><p>“The power sector is one of the top sources of carbon emissions and pollution,\\'\\' she said. \"With this pause to take a deeper dive into developing the most comprehensive and thoughtful rulemaking for existing gas plants, we have an opportunity to do this work correctly and effectively to protect the human and environmental health of the most overburdened, neglected and vulnerable people across the country.\\'\\'</p><p>The EPA\\'s revised plan was first reported by Bloomberg News.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-1499236035aa7c34dbec36a7144df25e20240229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BFJ-RDH1-JC5B-G496-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><timeReceived>11:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 29, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

About 2 in 10 Democrats don’t believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don’t know enough to say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since Biden’s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-democrats-president-trump-d5fb136a643edb020745336ff9709923\">debate debacle</url> on June 27, many Democrats have privately and even openly looked to Harris to step in and succeed Biden as the party’s presidential nominee, believing she has a better chance against GOP nominee Donald Trump. For her part, Harris has remained completely loyal to Biden, being one of his toughest defenders in the aftermath of the disastrous debate performance.</p><p>Oakley Graham, a Democrat in Greenwood, Missouri, said while he is “pretty happy” with Biden’s accomplishments in office, he felt that he would be more excited to support Harris at the top of the ticket and that it was “about time” a woman becomes president.</p><p>“I know he’s got unfinished business,” Graham, 30, said of Biden. “But it would be nice to see a person of color, a woman, somebody younger to step up and to lead that charge. I would hope that that would inspire a younger generation to be more engaged.”</p><p>Black adults –- a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/video/united-states-government-naacp-violence-kamala-harris-barack-obama-583f9d003c004dffa18bd0dce7b4c014\">key contingent</url> of the Democrats’ coalition and a group that remains relatively more favorable to Biden than others — are more likely than Americans overall to say that Harris would do well.</p><p>As for Americans more broadly, they are more skeptical of how Harris would perform in the Oval Office. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults overall say Harris would do well as president. About half say Harris would not do a good job in the role, and 2 in 10 say they don’t know enough to say.</p><p>Harris’ favorability rating is similar to Biden’s, but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is somewhat lower. The poll showed that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Harris, while about half have an unfavorable opinion. There are more Americans with a negative view of Biden: approximately 6 in 10. About 1 in 10 Americans say they don’t know enough to have an opinion of Harris, whereas nearly everyone has an opinion on Biden.</p><p>About three-quarters of Democrats have a positive view of Harris, which is in line with how Democrats view Biden. Seven in 10 have a favorable view of him.</p><p>Shannon Bailey, a Democrat who lives in Tampa, praised Biden’s accomplishments as president –- particularly with his infrastructure law and efforts to tame inflation --- and said he’ll be “remembered fondly.” But she had a more favorable view of Harris than she does the incumbent president because, in Bailey’s view, the vice president appears more “capable of handling the taxing nature of the job.”</p><p>“It’s not just the physical stamina part, but also the cognitive reasoning part right now,” said Bailey, 34. “It’s important to be able to concisely and persuasively get the message across that is the Democratic platform right now.”</p><p>Bailey said the Democratic Party needs Harris and a running mate “who can really motivate people to go out to the polls” — a task that she’s skeptical Biden can do as effectively.</p><p>Harris’s position as the administration’s lead messenger on abortion also has endeared her to many Democrats.</p><p>“I think she would be a very strong advocate for abortion, has been and would continue to be,” said Thomas Mattman, a Democrat from Chico, California. “The Republicans have gone with white men as their ticket, and both of them have said some pretty specific things about being opposed to abortion so I think that would be a very strong argument.”</p><p>Mattman, 59, said he believes Biden will not be able to defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump — a prospect that leaves Mattman “very distraught.” Harris would be a much more effective candidate because Biden is unable to “put pressure” on his opponent and exploit his weaknesses, Mattman said.</p><p>Harris is more popular among Black Americans than she is among white or Hispanic adults. She is more disliked by men than she is by women.</p><p>Other prominent Democrats who have been floated as potential replacements are less known than Harris is. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults don’t have an opinion of California Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gavin-newsom\">Gavin Newsom</url>, and half are unfamiliar with Michigan Gov. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/gretchen-whitmer\">Gretchen Whitmer</url>. Newsom is seen, overall, slightly more negatively than positively. Americans are divided about evenly on Whitmer: 24% have a favorable view and 22% have an unfavorable view.</p><p>More Democrats see Harris rather than Newsom or Whitmer as someone who would make a good president, though that\\'s partly because they\\'re relative unknowns. About one-third of Democrats say Newsom would make a good president, and half don’t know enough to say. About one-quarter of Democrats say Whitmer would do well, and about two-thirds don’t know enough to say.</p><p>Trump’s running mate, Senator <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/jd-vance\">JD Vance</url> of Ohio, is unknown to most Americans. In the AP-NORC poll, which was conducted before Trump made Vance his vice presidential choice, 6 in 10 Americans don’t know enough about him to form an opinion. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of Vance, and about 2 in 10 view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don’t know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative view.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,253 adults was conducted July 11-15, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-7ef83e5c8e510e39d7c54f7e2831006420240719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CHF-CV11-DYMD-62P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><timeReceived>10:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 19, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That denies Kennedy a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-rfk-cnn-debate-ballot-access-biden-trump-d3c5466a9a307ea4480508160f660a55\">singular opportunity</url> to stand alongside the leading candidates in an attempt to lend legitimacy to his <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/who-is-robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-097ac973a32ddf2e8e4edecd6a8f3153\">longshot bid</url> and convince potential supporters that he has a shot at winning.</p><p>In a statement Thursday, Kennedy called his exclusion from the debate “undemocratic, un-American, and cowardly.\"</p><p>Both the Biden and Trump campaigns fear that Kennedy could play spoiler in what\\'s anticipated to be a close general election.</p><p>According to the criteria set out by CNN, candidates would be invited to participate in the debate if they had secured a place on the ballot in states totaling at least 270 votes in the Electoral College, the minimum needed to win the presidency.</p><p>Biden and Trump have easily cleared the polling threshold but won’t be certified for the ballot until their parties formally nominate them later this summer. Both have secured enough delegates to lock in their nominations.</p><p>Kennedy’s campaign says he has satisfied the requirements to appear on the ballot in 22 states, with a combined 310 electoral votes, though not all have affirmed his name will be listed. California, the largest prize on the electoral map with 54 votes, will not certify any candidates until Aug. 29.</p><p>Candidates were also required to reach a polling threshold of 15% in four reliable national polls by June 20, another metric CNN said Kennedy failed to meet. According to the network, Kennedy has received at least 15% in three qualifying polls so far and is currently on the ballot in six states, making him currently eligible for 89 Electoral College votes.</p><p>Last month, Kennedy filed an election complaint alleging CNN is colluding with Biden and Trump to exclude him from the June 27 debate, alleging that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-rfk-cnn-debate-ballot-access-biden-trump-d3c5466a9a307ea4480508160f660a55\">participation requirements</url> were designed to ensure only Biden and Trump would qualify and claiming that he is being held to a higher standard.</p><p>CNN has said the complaint is without merit. Kennedy\\'s campaign did not immediately respond to a message Thursday seeking comment on CNN\\'s announcement and asking if he planned to take any further action about his exclusion.</p><p>Last month, Biden and Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8\">agreed to the CNN debate</url> and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.</p><p>After winning a coin toss, Biden\\'s campaign chose the right podium position, meaning that he will be on the right side of viewers\\' screens, with Trump on the left, according to CNN. Trump\\'s campaign then opted to deliver his closing statement after Biden.</p><p>Both campaigns have agreed to appear at podiums, and microphones will be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.</p><p>___</p><p>Kinnard can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\">http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-de23c5bf08e33e0df8639ff11d1ff42420240620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C99-YNM1-JC5B-G0FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>7:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 20, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A smaller majority of Republicans – 56% – say the same about a Biden triumph. About 6 in 10 Democrats cite both emotions when contemplating a Trump victory.

Biden faces <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-2024-progressives-democrats-trump-e6839356359a7ab7560b66be78e9fb3b\">disenchanted progressives</url> to his left and concerns over whether his age, 81, is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-poll-trump-2024-620e0a5cfa0039a6448f607c17c7f23e\">liability in the job</url>.</p><p>Excitement about the two candidates will be an important factor in a race where turnout from each side’s base will be key. But dislike can motivate voters as much as enthusiasm.</p><p>“If there was a third-party candidate who had a chance in hell I would vote for them,” said Austin Healey, a 26-year-old Democrat. Healey, who describes himself as “very liberal,” said his mixed reviews of Biden take a back seat to his concerns that Trump\\'s comeback bid “looks like a clear ploy for trying to abolish democracy.”</p><p>Though he is “not excited about it,” Healey said, that means a vote for Biden.</p><p>Derrick Johnson, a Michigan voter who identifies as a liberal independent, offered plenty of critiques against Biden, as well. But the 46-year-old caregiver and food service worker made his bottom line clear: “Donald Trump is a madman. I’m afraid he’ll have us in World War III. My message is anybody but Trump.”</p><p>Democrats’ intense feelings about Trump account for the overall differences in how Americans view the two rivals. Altogether, about 4 in 10 U.S. adults say “fearful” would describe their emotions “extremely” or “very” well if Trump is elected again, while roughly 3 in 10 would fear a second Biden term. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults said they would be angered by Trump winning in November while 28% said the same about Biden.</p><p>The poll’s findings on negative emotions could be especially important for Biden given his other weak spots, including that Republicans remain more excited about electing Trump again than Democrats are about reelecting Biden. Slightly more than half of Republicans, 54%, said “excited” describes their feelings about another Trump term “extremely well” or “very well.” For Biden, that number was just 4 in 10 among Democrats.</p><p>“We know what we’re getting with Trump,” said Republican John Novak, a 54-year-old maintenance worker who lives in swing-state Wisconsin and counted himself among those GOP loyalists who would be excited by another Trump term.</p><p>“I knew who he was when he <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/c5d4d91701744089b36806200744b7fc\">came down that escalator in 2015,</url> and we were never getting Boy Scout material,” Novak said. “But he put conservatives on the Supreme Court, he was firm on immigration ... and he’s a conservative who handled the economy.”</p><p>The latest AP-NORC poll showed Biden with an overall approval rating of 38%. U.S. adults also expressed discontent about his handling of the economy and immigration – and not all of the disapproval is driven by partisan loyalties. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Biden’s stewardship of the economy, roughly equal to his overall job approval rating.</p><p>On specific issues, about 3 in 10 Democrats disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy; about 4 in 10 disapprove of his approach to immigration or border security.</p><p>“The situation at the border really bothers me,” said Johnson, the Michigan liberal. “The border crossings are just getting out of control.”</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-state-of-union-takeaways-31cfc7a93213f052eb3f8a0bf51173d9\">president and his campaign advisers tout</url> the Biden administration’s legislative record, especially on infrastructure, an improving economy and new spending intended to combat climate change. But the president and his allies are also unsparing in lambasting Trump as interested only in “revenge and retribution” for his defeat in 2020 and the pending criminal prosecutions and other legal troubles that have followed.</p><p>They have seized on Trump’s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-orban-hungary-conservatives-autocrats-biden-97d6998f747d3543f2f1df069b0f9165\">praise of authoritarians</url> like Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Victor Orban and recirculated the former president’s statement that he would be willing to act like a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72\">dictator for a day</url> to close the border and expand drilling for fossil fuel.</p><p>Trump has countered with searing attacks on Biden’s mental acuity and physical fitness for the presidency and even mocked <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/7670c784a29d8cf6e60558156bdd239e\">Biden’s stutter</url>. But the latest poll results suggest Trump has not yet maximized the potential benefits of those attacks — or perhaps that they simply have a lower yield for him.</p><p>Biden sometimes turns his version of the argument into a humorous quip he used often in 2020, when he was vying to unseat Trump: “Don’t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative.”</p><p>Indeed, that is what resonates with reluctant Democrats and some independents.</p><p>“I voted for Trump (in 2016) because I wanted somebody to shake up Washington,” said Neil Murray, a 67-year-old retiree in Jonesboro, Arkansas, who identifies as an independent. “He certainly did that, but he couldn’t do anything productive with it.”</p><p>Frustrated with Trump’s negative qualities that he overlooked in 2016, Murray voted for Biden in 2020 — but not enthusiastically. He called Biden “disingenuous on some things” and too close to his left flank on economic policy.</p><p>But in November, Murray said, he will have no reservations when casting a second vote for the Democrat, because, “Donald Trump is a screaming lunatic.”</p><p>___</p><p>Sanders reported from Washington.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,282 adults was conducted March 21-25, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

About 3 in 10 say these qualities better describe Trump.</p><p>About 4 in 10 say Harris is someone who “cares about people like you” while about 3 in 10 say that about Trump. About 4 in 10 say “honest” better describes Harris and 24% say that quality better describes Trump.</p><p>Both parties are racing to define Harris as she <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-democratic-presidential-nomination-eb43b6b346cc644b2d195315cb2bfb20\">prepares to accept the Democratic nomination</url> at the party’s convention next week. The poll suggests she carries some of the same baggage that weighed down President Joe Biden before he ended his reelection bid but has advantages over Trump when they\\'re compared to each other. And Democrats <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-joe-biden-kamala-harris-donald-trump-1feb5ed3c2e29623ce3cec3565b487cd\">continue to be much happier</url> about her candidacy than they were about Biden\\'s.</p><p>Trump has spent the campaign championing himself as a strong leader who is capable of handling tough crises facing the country and suggesting that foreign leaders wouldn\\'t respect Harris in the White House. But he doesn\\'t have an advantage with Americans on that characteristic, according to the survey. Four in 10 U.S. adults see Trump as a strong leader, and roughly the same share say that about Harris. About 4 in 10 say Trump is capable of handling a crisis, and a similar share say Harris is better positioned to do so.</p><p>Americans are about evenly divided between who they think is more capable of winning in November — Trump or Harris. In July, before Biden dropped out of the race, only about 2 in 10 Americans <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-2024-W1-topline.pdf\">thought he was more capable of winning</url>, while about twice as many thought that about Trump.</p><p>“Trump had a better chance when Joe Biden was running,” said Lisa Miller, a 42-year-old student in Elko, Nevada, and a Republican. “I think a lot of people who were insecure about Joe Biden are more secure with Kamala Harris’ age and cognitive abilities.”</p><h>Trump has advantages on the economy and immigration</h><p>Americans are more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy or immigration, but the difference is slight — 45% say Trump is better positioned to handle the economy, while 38% say that about Harris. The difference is similar in handling immigration. Independents are about twice as likely to trust Trump over Harris on economic issues, and they give him the advantage on immigration as well.</p><p>Howard Barnes, a 36-year-old artist in San Francisco, is a Republican who says he trusts Trump over Harris on the border.</p><p>“She doesn’t really seem to be proactive about it or even interested in it,” Barnes said.</p><p>Harris has more of an advantage over Trump when it comes to handling issues related to race and racial inequality, abortion policy, and health care. Roughly half of U.S. adults say Harris would do a better job than Trump handling each of those issues, compared with about 3 in 10 for Trump. Harris is especially strong among Democrats, independents and women on the issue of abortion policy.</p><p>Democrats and independents give her the edge on health care, as well as on issues of race and racial inequality. About two-thirds of Black adults say Harris is the candidate they trust more on that issue, as well as about half of Hispanic adults and white adults.</p><p>Harris’ strengths also accentuate two areas where Republicans give Trump relatively low marks: abortion policy and issues related to race and racial inequality. Only about 6 in 10 Republicans trust Trump over Harris on these issues.</p><p>There are possible signs of trouble for Harris in the poll, though. Only about 6 in 10 Democrats trust her over Trump to do a better job handling the war in Gaza, her lowest rating within her party on the issues asked about. About one-quarter of Democrats say they trust neither Trump nor Harris on this topic.</p><h>Democrats are more excited about the election now</h><p>About two-thirds of Democrats say “excited” describes either extremely well or very well how they would feel if Harris were to be elected.</p><p>The enthusiasm represents a sharp reversal from when Biden was the Democrats’ candidate: an <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/few-excited-many-angry-and-fearful-about-biden-trump-reelection/\">AP-NORC poll from March</url> found that only 4 in 10 Democrats said “excited” would describe their feelings extremely or very well if he won another term. About 7 in 10 Democrats say “satisfied” would describe their emotions at least very well if Harris won. That’s also a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/few-excited-many-angry-and-fearful-about-biden-trump-reelection/\">shift from March</url>, when half of Democrats said this about Biden.</p><p>“There’s definitely joy and there’s definitely hope, and I feel like that’s something that’s been missing,” said Meaghan Dunfee, a 33-year-old public-sector worker in Hamilton, New Jersey. “I don’t think we’ve had that in a long time on the Democratic side.”</p><p>About 2 in 10 independents say they would be either excited or satisfied by Harris being elected, an increase from their response to the Biden question in March. Roughly half of independents say excitement would describe their emotions at least “somewhat” well, up from about one-quarter in March. Similar shares of independents say they would be excited or satisfied about Trump being elected.</p><p>___</p><p>Cooper reported from Phoenix.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,164 adults was conducted August 8-12, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

More than half of the basin’s miles of rivers and streams were in poor condition for nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that drains into waterways, the agency found. For decades, federal and state officials have struggled to control farm runoff, the biggest source of nutrient pollution that is not typically federally regulated.</p><p>It’s a problem only expected to get harder to control as climate change produces more intense storms that dump rain on the Midwest and South. Those heavy rains flood farm fields, pick up commercial fertilizers and carry them into nearby rivers.</p><p>“It’s really worrying that we are clearly not meeting the goals that we’ve set for ourselves,” said Olivia Dorothy, director of river restoration with the conservation group American Rivers.</p><p>The assessment is based on samples collected in 2018 and 2019 and it allows experts to compare river conditions from previous rounds of sampling, although different sampling sites were used. It takes years for the agency to compile the results and release the report, which is the most comprehensive assessment of the nation’s river and stream health. Phosphorus levels dipped slightly while nitrogen levels remained almost exactly the same.</p><p>About half of all river miles were found to be in poor condition for snails, worms, beetles and other bottom dwelling species that are an important indicator of biological health of the river. About a third were also rated as having poor conditions for fish based on species diversity.</p><p>“Controlling pollution is a big job. It is hard work,” said Tom Wall, director of watershed restoration, assessment and protection division at EPA. “Things are not getting worse, despite the tremendous pressures on our waterways. And we would like to see more progress.\"</p><p>Water pollution from factories and industry is typically federally regulated. The Biden administration recently proposed toughening regulations on meat and poultry processing plants to reduce pollution, Wall said.</p><p>When nutrient pollution flows into the Gulf of Mexico, it spurs growth of bacteria that consume oxygen. That creates a so-called “dead zone,” a vast area where it’s difficult or impossible for marine animals to survive, fluctuating from about the size of Rhode Island to the size of New Jersey, according to Nancy Rabalais, professor of oceanography and wetland studies at Louisiana State University.</p><p>That affects the productivity of commercial fisheries and marine life in general, but nutrient pollution is also damaging upstream. Too much nitrate in drinking water can affect how blood carries oxygen, causing human health problems like headaches, nausea and abdominal cramps. It can especially affect infants, sometimes inducing “blue baby syndrome,” which causes the skin to take on a bluish hue.</p><p>The EPA established the hypoxia task force in the late 1990s to reduce nutrient pollution and shrink the dead zone, but it relies on voluntary efforts to reduce farm runoff and hasn\\'t significantly reduced the dead zone.</p><p>Anne Schechinger, Midwest director with the Environmental Working Group, said new regulations are needed, not voluntary efforts. She said the Biden administration has done a lot to improve drinking water, but not enough to reduce agricultural runoff.</p><p>Methods to prevent runoff include building buffers between farmland and waterways, creating new wetlands to filter pollutants and applying less fertilizer.</p><p>It’s a politically fraught issue, especially in major Midwest farming states that significantly contribute to the problem. Many of those states cite their voluntary conservation programs as evidence they’re taking on the problem, yet the new EPA data shows little progress.</p><p>Minnesota is one of the few states that has a so-called “buffer law” that requires vegetation to be planted along rivers, streams and public drainage ditches. But because groundwater and surface water are closely connected in much of the Upper Midwest, nutrient pollution can end up leaching underground through farm fields and eventually bypass those buffers, ending up in streams anyway, said Gregory Klinger, who works for the Olmsted County, Minnesota soil and water conservation district.</p><p>There should also be a focus on preventing over-fertilizing – about 30% of farmers are still using more than the recommended amounts of fertilizer on their fields, said Brad Carlson, an extension educator with the University of Minnesota who communicates with farmers about nutrient pollution issues.</p><p>Martin Larsen, a farmer and conservation technician in southeast Minnesota, said he and other farmers are interested in practices that reduce their nutrient pollution. He’s broken up his typical corn and soybean rotation with oats and medium red clover, the latter a kind of plant that can increase nitrogen levels in the soil naturally. He\\'s been able to get by with about half as much fertilizer for a corn crop that follows a clover planting as compared to a corn-corn rotation.</p><p>Growing oats and red clover as cover crops improves soil, too. But Larsen said it’s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/cover-crops-farming-carbon-nitrogen-1648449f90b7072be50b95a21d733618\">difficult for many farmers to plant them</url> when they often rely on an immediate payback for anything they grow. Cover crops are planted on just 5.1% of harvested farmland, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/100551/eib-222.pdf?v=9316.6\">according to 2017 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</url></p><p>Larsen said since regulations are so unpopular, more should be done to incentivize better practices. For example, he said that could include companies shifting the makeup of feed they use for animals, giving farmers an opening to plant some crops that use less fertilizer. Or government programs that do more to subsidize things like cover crops.</p><p>He said that many farmers in his community acknowledge the need to do things differently. “But we also feel very trapped in the system,” he said.</p><p>___</p><p>Walling reported from Chicago.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Melina Walling on X: <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MelinaWalling\">@MelinaWalling.</url></p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

I didn\\'t feel like dying,\" Williams said. “I don’t think anyone should have to go into financial ruin to live.”</p><p>Many Americans agree, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/views-toward-student-loan-relief-are-tied-to-partisanship-and-experience-with-debt/\">a new poll</url> from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/\">The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</url>. According to the survey, about half of Americans say it’s extremely or very important for the U.S. government to provide debt relief for those who have yet to pay off medical treatments.</p><p>Especially since the pandemic, an increasing <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/health-care-costs-boston-toledo-e423c64c1322bc8e4254b7a70b1da50c\">number of cities and states</url> — including Connecticut, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/rip-medical-debt-new-york-city-adams-1f39530cd79937ced52f47ab4749fb58\">New York City</url>, New Orleans and Chicago — are implementing their own versions of medical debt forgiveness. The Biden administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/medical-debt-credit-report-biden-ff69ce483467062d94f083116e4de8cc\">recently announced</url> a proposed rule that would wipe consumer medical debt off most credit reports.</p><p>The poll found that support for medical debt forgiveness is particularly high in cases where a patient experienced health care fraud. About two-thirds of U.S. adults support medical debt forgiveness if the individual has, for example, been wrongfully billed for services. But majorities of Americans favor relief in other situations, too, such as when the patient has made on-time payments toward an existing loan for 20 years, has large amounts of medical debt compared to their income, or is experiencing financial hardship.</p><p>About 6 in 10 people with debt from medical bills favor medical debt forgiveness if the person has large amounts of debt compared to their income, compared to about half of people without medical debt.</p><p>Denise Early, 65, an Independent in Omaha, Nebraska, who favors medical debt forgiveness, said she experienced an injury on the job that eventually led to several surgeries she believes should have been covered by workers\\' compensation claims, but were not. The costs eventually pushed her to declare bankruptcy.</p><p>Early worked as a custodian at a post office, she said, when she suffered an accident. After initial hospital visits and treatments were ineffective, Early eventually received knee and ankle surgeries to address ongoing difficulties.</p><p>“I still get bills every day,” Early said. “Forgiveness would help clear a lot of my debts.”</p><p>Early said she also currently has more than $100,000 in unpaid student loan debt.</p><p>Although reducing student loan debt <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/student-loan-cancellation-forgiveness-college-debt-e5ad2748058cfd037e0323321f532836\">has been a focus for President Joe Biden</url>, the poll found that Americans are more likely to say medical debt relief should be a government priority. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults said that it’s extremely or very important for the U.S. government to provide student debt relief.</p><p>Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, who helped craft the poll, said the survey captures a divide regarding who deserves debt relief.</p><p>“If you need to go to the emergency room because of a major health issue, that is much less of an active choice than the decision to go to college,\" she said. “Even though, given today\\'s economy, going to college is in many ways a very important if not essential route to economic mobility and stability.”</p><p>Overall, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are all similarly likely to support clearing medical debt if the person experienced fraud, the AP-NORC poll found, though Democrats are more supportive than Republicans in cases where the person is experiencing financial hardship or if the person has large amounts of medical debt compared to their income.</p><p>Ed Kane, a 71-year-old Republican from Chicopee, Massachusetts, believes medical debt forgiveness should not be an option. He\\'s survived multiple medical emergencies — including heart attacks and cancer — and credits his employer health insurance for providing good coverage that kept him out of debt.</p><p>“We are starting to become a nation that gives away everything. And I’m tired of it,” Kane said. “I’ve worked hard all my life. I worked two jobs. I had great medical insurance because of it. Everybody can do it; there’s no reason that people can’t reach a higher level than they do.”</p><p>Medical debt forgiveness is also a higher priority for Democrats. According to the poll, about two-thirds of Democrats say it\\'s extremely or very important for the U.S. government to provide medical debt relief, compared to about 3 in 10 Republicans.</p><p>Matt Haskell, 24, of Englewood, Florida, a Republican who said he supports debt forgiveness, also has firsthand experience with high medical bills for an unexpected emergency.</p><p>Haskell said he was working on cars, some of which were rusty, at the time of his accident. One afternoon, what seemed like a piece of dust got into his eye.</p><p>“It turned out it was a metal flake embedded in my cornea,” Haskell said. “I didn’t know for five days. I went to the ER when I could no longer open my eyes.”</p><p>From the visit, Haskell said he incurred more than $4,500 in debt.</p><p>“I generally think it’s never anybody’s fault when they have a medical condition,” he said. “If they get cancer or a tumor or have an episode from undiagnosed diabetes — it’s not someone’s fault if they develop something and now they’re thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,309 adults was conducted May 16-21, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

You don’t vote yes or no, you vote for a candidate.”</p><p>The party proceeded with a vote, even with just one candidate, “to make sure we’re as inclusive as possible,” she said, and to avoid any inference that party leaders were deciding candidates themselves.</p><p>Alaska will allocate 15 pledged delegates based on the vote.</p><h>WYOMING</h><p>Biden won in Wyoming, where polling determined which candidate got the state\\'s 17 national delegates.</p><p>The caucuses also decided who goes to the state Democratic convention on June 1 in Casper.

With Biden out of the race, many of these young leaders are now hoping Harris can overcome his faltering support among Gen Z and harness a new explosion of energy among young voters.</p><p>Since last Sunday, statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country, including in <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/LUCHA_AZ/status/1815143973457154501\">Arizona</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/OurWisconsinRev/status/1815094278512849118\">Wisconsin</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/MichiganUnitedAction/posts/873436921491371\">Michigan</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eqca.org/biden-resigning/\">California</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/UnidosMN/status/1815095144896745702\">Minnesota</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://equalityncpac.org/2024/07/21/equality-nc-extends-its-heartfelt-thank-you-to-president-biden/\">North Carolina</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/fl-opa-kh?refcode=EM_FL_OPA_20240722_fr_Kamala_team_pb_act_xx_hdr\">Pennsylvania</url>, as leaders thanked Biden for stepping aside and celebrated the opportunity to organize around a new candidate. On Friday, a coalition of 17 youth-led groups endorsed Harris.</p><p>“This changes everything,” said Zo Tobi, director of communication for the Movement Voter Project, a national progressive funding group focusing on youth-led organizations, when he heard the news that Biden was dropping out of the race and endorsing Harris. “The world as it is suddenly shifted into the world as it could be.”</p><p>As the campaign enters a new phase, both Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are delivering messages aimed at younger voters who could prove decisive in some of the most hotly contested states.</p><p>Harris recorded a brief video message shown Saturday at a conference of Gen Z activists and elected officials in Atlanta.</p><p>“We know young voters will be key, and we know your vote cannot be taken for granted,” Harris told the gathering, highlighting her support for gun safety, abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and action to combat climate change.</p><p>Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director for Harris’ campaign, attended the conference in Atlanta, and she praised young voters across the country for their response to the vice president’s elevation to likely nominee.</p><p>“As amazing as it is to see the tremendous youth enthusiasm online, what has been even more incredible is how that online energy has already translated into a tangible desire to take action and get involved with our campaign,” she said, citing new voter registrations, small donations from young voters and student requests to help start campus-based campaign organizations.</p><p>Trump, in his own address Friday in Florida to a conference on faith hosted by Turning Point USA, derided Harris as an “incompetent” and a “far left\" vice president. He vowed to champion religious Americans\\' causes in a second White House term.</p><p>“With your vote, I will defend religious liberty in all of its forms,” Trump told the conservative group that focuses on high school, college and university campuses. \"I will protect Christians in our schools and our military and our government and our workplaces and our hospitals, in our public square and I will also protect other religions.\"</p><p>John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, who has worked with Biden, said the “white-hot energy” among young people is something he hasn\\'t seen since former President Barack Obama’s campaign. While there\\'s little reliable polling so far, he described the dynamic as “a combination of the hopefulness we saw with Obama and the urgency and fight we saw after the Parkland shooting.”</p><p>In many ways, it was the first time many young people felt heard and felt like their actions could have an impact on politics, he and several young leaders said.</p><p>“It’s reset this election in profound ways,\" he said. \"People, especially young people, for so long, for so many important reasons have been despondent about politics, despondent about the direction of the country. It’s weighed on them. And then they wake up the next morning, and it seems like everything’s changed.”</p><p>About 6 in 10 adults under 30 voted for Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, but his ratings with the group have dipped substantially since then, with only about a quarter of the group saying they had a favorable opinion of him in the most recent AP-NORC poll, conducted before Biden withdrew from the race.</p><p>That poll, along with polls from The New York Times/Siena and from CNN that were conducted after Biden dropped out, suggest that Harris starts off with somewhat better favorable ratings than Biden among young adults.</p><p>Sunjay Muralitharan, vice president of College Democrats of America, said it felt like a weight was lifted off his chest when Harris entered the race.</p><p>Despite monthly coalition calls between youth-led groups and the Biden campaign, Muralitharan spent months worrying about how Biden would fare among young voters as he watched young people leave organizations such as the College Democrats and Young Democrats to join more leftist groups.</p><p>College Democrats issued statements and social media posts encouraging the party to prioritize young people and to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/us/politics/biden-israel-college-protest.html?smid=nytcore-android-share\">change course</url> on the war in Gaza and have “worked tirelessly to get College Dems programming” at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this summer. But they received limited outreach in return, Muralitharan said.</p><p>A Harris campaign represents an opportunity to move in a new direction, he said. The vice president has shown her vocal support for issues important to young voters such as climate change and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/harris-abortion-biden-election-congress-0df7d4956b4323b77139f55f7fe22a75\">reproductive rights</url>, Muralitharan said, adding that she may also be able to change course and distance herself from Biden\\'s approach to the war in Gaza.</p><p>“The perpetual roadblock we’ve run into is that Biden is the lesser of two evils and his impact on the crisis in Gaza,\" he said. \"For months, we’ve been given this broken script that’s made it difficult for us to organize young voters. But that changes now.”</p><p>Santiago Mayer, executive director of the Gen Z voter engagement organization Voters of Tomorrow, said the Biden campaign “created an entirely new framework for operating with youth organizations” that can now be transitioned into supporting Harris\\' campaign.</p><p>“Gen Z loves VP Harris, and VP Harris loves Gen Z,\" he said. \"So we’re ready to get to work for her.”</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\\\\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

The poll shows 31% of U.S. adults approve of Biden\\'s handling of the conflict, including just 46% of Democrats. That\\'s as an earlier spike in support for Israel following the Hamas attacks Oct. 7 sags.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Melissa Morales, a 36-year-old political independent in Runnemede, New Jersey, says she finds herself watching videos and news from Gaza daily. Images of Palestinian children wounded, orphaned or unhoused by the fighting in Gaza make her mind go to her own 3-year-old boy.</p><p>“I just can\\'t even imagine, like, my son roaming the streets, wanting to be safe. Wanting his mom. Or just wanting someone to get him,” she said.</p><p>Israel’s offensive has gone too far, Morales says, and so has the Biden administration’s support for it. Biden has supported Israel militarily and diplomatically since the first hours after the Hamas militant group’s Oct. 7 attacks, which Israel says killed 1,200 people.</p><p>The U.S. has become increasingly isolated in its support of Israel as the Palestinian death toll rises past 27,000, with two-thirds of the victims women and children. The Biden administration says it is pressing Israel to reduce its killing of civilians and allow in more humanitarian aid.</p><p>“These kids ... they\\'re needing the end of this,” Morales said. \"It\\'s such an unfair fight.\"</p><p>John Milor, a cybersecurity expert in Clovis, California, who describes himself as a Republican-voting independent, says he remains “100%” behind Israel.</p><p>But Milor notices more young people in his circle speaking out against Israel. A visit to a family friend led to Milor being aghast when the man\\'s stepson denounced Israelis as “warmongers.”</p><p>“And I\\'m like, ”You\\'re kidding, right?\"\\' Milor recounted.</p><p>‘’It\\'s not like they asked to be attacked, you know,\" Milor said by phone this week. \"And they still have hostages over there.\"</p><p>The poll shows 33% of Republicans now say Israel’s military response has gone too far, up from 18% in November. Fifty-two percent of independents say that, up from 39%. Sixty-two percent of Democrats say they feel that way, roughly the same majority as in November.</p><p>In all, 50% of U.S. adults now believe Israel\\'s military offensive has gone beyond what it should have, the poll found. That’s up from 40% in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/hostage-recovery-tops-publics-priorities-for-israel-hamas-conflict/\">AP-NORC poll conducted in November</url>.</p><p>The new poll was conducted from Jan. 25 to 28. That overlapped with the killing of three U.S. troops in Jordan, the first deaths among American service members in what\\'s been widening regional conflict since Oct. 7. U.S. officials blamed a drone strike by a Hamas-allied militia.</p><p>The new poll\\'s findings include more worrying news for President Joe Biden when it comes to support from his own political party.</p><p>Fracture lines are growing in his Democratic base, with some key Democratic blocs that Biden will likely need if he\\'s going to win a second term unhappy with his handling of the conflict.</p><p>About 6 in 10 non-white Democrats disapprove of how Biden is approaching the conflict, while about half of white Democrats approve.</p><p>Notably, about 7 in 10 Democrats under 45 disapprove. That\\'s the opposite of the attitude of older Democrats, among whom nearly 6 in 10 approve.</p><p>Sarah Jackson, a 31-year-old professional closet designer in Chicago, is a Democrat. She says Biden has been about right in his level of support for both Israel and the Palestinians.</p><p>But as Israel\\'s air and ground offensive goes on, Jackson\\'s thoughts turn to finding the best way to phase down U.S. support for it, she says.</p><p>“At first I was very supportive, because I did believe they need some type of help,” Jackson said.</p><p>“But yes, as it goes on, I do become more worried,\" she said. That includes worrying a new leader will take office here, and phase down support for Israel too abruptly, she says.</p><p>About 7 in 10 of the Democrats who disapprove of Biden\\'s handling of the conflict say it’s extremely or very important for the U.S. to help negotiate a permanent ceasefire.</p><p>The poll also shows about half of U.S. adults are extremely or very concerned that the latest war between Israel and Hamas will lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East.</p><p>About half have heard “a lot” or “some” about the airstrikes from the United States and British militaries against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the airstrikes, including about 6 in 10 of those who say they’ve heard a lot or some about them. About an additional 4 in 10 say they neither approve nor disapprove, and about 1 in 10 disapprove.</p><p>The poll shows 35% of U.S. adults now describe Israel as an ally that shares U.S. interests and values. That’s back in line with the views from before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, after a brief increase in November to 44%.</p><p>Thirty-six percent of U.S. adults say the U.S. is not supportive enough of the Palestinians, up slightly from 31% December.</p><p>About 6 in 10 call recovering hostages being held by Hamas an important U.S. priority, but only about 3 in 10 say it’s highly important to provide aid to Israel’s military to fight Hamas.</p><p>A similar share of U.S. adults say that about negotiating the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.</p><p>“If Hamas were in charge, absolutely not,” Milor said on the subject of an independent Palestinian nation. He said he worried that any Palestinian state would become a base for broader attacks.</p><p>But Morales, the woman from northwest New Jersey, said Palestinians should have a safe state, or at least a safe community.</p><p>“Everyone deserves a safe space where they can just be. Without interference because of who they are,” she said.</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,152 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, designed to represent the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-4159b28d313c6c37abdb7f14162bcdd120240202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B7M-N6B1-JC5B-G2P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><timeReceived>6:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 2, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

They largely ignored <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-panic-performance-democrats-debate-trump-cnn-fe6546f2c9762e80e6067ba10abedea8\">Biden\\'s weak showing Thursday night</url> or the avalanche of criticism that followed.</p><p>Multiple committee members on the call, most granted anonymity to talk about the private discussion, described feeling like they were being gaslighted — that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party’s predicament. The call, they said, may have worsened a widespread sense of panic among elected officials, donors and other stakeholders.</p><p>Instead, the people said, Harrison offered what they described as a rosy assessment of Biden\\'s path forward.

But we didn’t get that. We were being gaslit.”</p><p>Many donors, party strategists and rank-and-file DNC members are publicly and privately saying they want the 81-year-old Biden to step aside to allow the party to select a younger replacement at the Democratic National Convention in August. As of now, though, Biden\\'s closest allies insist he remains well-positioned to compete against <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Republican Donald Trump</url> and have given no indication they will push him to end his campaign.</p><p>Those best positioned to replace him — Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer among them — reiterated their support for Biden after the debate.</p><p>Many are anxiously awaiting the first major round of post-debate public polling to determine their next steps.</p><p>Polls from CNN and 538/Ipsos conducted soon after the debate found that most debate-watchers thought Trump outperformed Biden. But the two men’s favorability ratings remained largely unchanged, just as they did in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-conviction-what-to-know-a70941a7cd367f7b2aa3218ea91ad922\">aftermath of Trump’s conviction on charges in New York</url> that he illegally participated in a hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election.</p><p>In a subsequent appearance on MSNBC, Harrison downplayed the significance of the conference call, which he said was part of a regularly scheduled communication “to talk about the state of the race” and the upcoming national convention with the DNC’s many elected members across the country.</p><p>Biden and his campaign have sought to project confidence in the days since Thursday\\'s debate in which the president, who already faced serious concerns about his physical and mental stamina, offered a performance punctuated by repeated stumbles, uncomfortable pauses, and a quiet speaking style that was often difficult to understand.</p><p>Just after Saturday\\'s DNC call, the Biden campaign released a memo from senior adviser Jen O\\'Malley Dillon insisting that the debate had no tangible impact on the election.</p><p>“On every metric that matters, data shows it did nothing to change the American people’s perception, our supporters are more fired up than ever, and Donald Trump only reminded voters of why they fired him four years ago and failed to expand his appeal beyond his MAGA base,” O\\'Malley Dillon wrote.</p><p>She added, “If we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Biden <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-debate-donors-trump-campaign-2024-419531be556da1447856f17549371cd7\">spent much of Saturday courting wealthy donors</url> in New York\\'s famed wealthy enclave of the Hamptons.</p><p>“I didn’t have a great night, but neither did Trump,\" Biden said of the debate at one gathering in East Hampton.</p><p>Of Trump, Biden said, “The big takeaway was his lies.”</p><p>Harrison reinforced the president\\'s message on the DNC call, which spanned roughly an hour. Hannah Muldavin, a DNC spokesperson, said the discussion was a regularly scheduled quarterly conference call with the committee\\'s membership.</p><p>The topics included Biden\\'s energetic North Carolina appearance the day after the debate and a fundraising surge that produced more than $27 million for the campaign between debate day through Friday evening, Muldavin said.</p><p>Harrison did not ignore the debate altogether in his remarks, she said.</p><p>He briefly referenced Biden\\'s comments from his North Carolina speech that he doesn\\'t debate as well as he used to, but that he knows how to get up when he gets knocked down.</p><p>Salazar noted that Harrison also suggested that party leaders always knew the 2024 presidential contest would be close, a regular Democratic talking point that irks Salazar.</p><p>“This should not be a close race,” Salazar said, pointing to Trump\\'s criminal record and long history of falsehoods. “They’re the ones who should be looking for a new nominee, not us. And unfortunately for us, because of our president’s performance on Thursday night, that is now an open discussion.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Washington and Josh Boak in East Hampton, New York, contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-aa08cc2b556b315e728d1e9c2bf81be920240630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CCC-FFW1-DYMD-60V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><timeReceived>3:56 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 30, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But neither has provided many details on how they would get there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris briefly mentioned climate change as she outlined “fundamental freedoms” at stake in the election, including “the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.”</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As vice president, Harris cast the tiebreaking vote on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-science-congress-climate-and-environment-f084d23d61ebb068068d4aa92c82fdbb\">Inflation Reduction Act</url>, President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law that was approved with only Democratic support. As a senator from California, she was an early sponsor of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/385ab89f01024aa99e64c5cdb97f0d16\">Green New Deal</url>, a sweeping series of proposals meant to swiftly move the United States to fully green energy that is championed by the party’s most progressive wing.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, led chants of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-policies-agenda-election-2024-second-term-d656d8f08629a8da14a65c4075545e0f\">“drill, baby, drill”</url> and pledged to dismantle the Biden administration’s “green new scam” in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. He has vowed to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal and repeal key parts of the 2022 climate law.</p><p>“We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far,” Trump said at the convention. “We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy.”</p><h>‘Climate champion’ or unfair regulations?</h><p>Environmental groups, which largely back Harris, call her a “proven climate champion” who will take on Big Oil and build on Biden\\'s climate legacy, including policies that boost electric vehicles and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/power-plants-coal-natural-gas-biden-epa-5c96ca146e7f70b47806beb4bc3713e6\">limit planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants</url>.</p><p>\"We won’t go back to a climate denier in the Oval Office,\\'\\' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action.</p><p>Republicans counter that Biden and Harris have spent four years adopting “punishing regulations” that target American energy while lavishing generous <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicle-tax-credit-treasury-government-bcbbc0fd7eac8b970d419260c8ed577b\">tax credits for electric vehicles</url> and other green priorities that cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</p><p>“This onslaught of overreaching and outrageous climate rules will shut down power plants and increase energy costs for families across the country,\\'\\' said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. \"Republicans will work to stop them and fight for solutions that protect our air and water and allow our economy to grow.”</p><p>Democrats have a clear edge on the issue. More than half of U.S. adults say they trust Harris “a lot” or “some” when it comes to addressing climate change, according to an <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/July-2024-W2-climate-topline.pdf\">Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in July</url>. About 7 in 10 say they have “not much” trust in Trump or “none at all” when it comes to climate. Fewer than half say they lack trust in Harris.</p><p>A look at where the two candidates stand on key climate and energy issues:</p><h>Fracking and offshore drilling</h><p>Harris said during her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign that she opposed offshore drilling for oil and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DibvhzmbrTA\">hydraulic fracturing</url>, an oil and gas extraction process better known as fracking.</p><p>But her campaign has clarified that she <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/fracking-pennsylvania-president-campaign-donald-trump-kamala-harris-104f3f051df4d28e4645f05051eb6cff\">no longer supports a ban on fracking</url>, a common drilling practice crucial to the economy in Pennsylvania, a key swing state and the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas.</p><p>“As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking,\\'\\' Harris told CNN on Thursday in her first major television interview as the nominee. \"We can grow ... a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.\\'\\'</p><p>Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington research firm, said Harris’ evolving views show she is “trying to balance climate voters and industry supporters,\\\\u2033 even as her campaign takes ”an adversarial stance\\\\u2033 with the oil and gas industry overall.</p><p>Harris and Democrats have cited new rules — authorized by the climate law — to increase royalties that oil and gas companies pay to drill or mine on public lands. She also has supported efforts to clean up old drilling sites and cap abandoned wells that often spew methane and other pollutants.</p><p>Trump, who pushed to roll back <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-public-health-climate-birds-a947e76f1023b739121692096322da24\">scores of environmental laws as president</url>, says his goal is for the U.S. to have the cheapest energy and electricity in the world. He’d increase oil drilling on public lands, offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers and speed approval of natural gas pipelines.</p><h>Electric vehicles</h><p>Trump has frequently criticized tough new vehicle emissions rules imposed by Biden, incorrectly labeling them an electric vehicle “mandate.\\\\u2033 Environmental Protection Agency rules issued this spring target tailpipe emissions from <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-electric-vehicles-emissions-limits-climate-biden-e6d581324af51294048df24269b5d20a\">cars</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-trucks-buses-emissions-climate-electric-vehicle-77da206eed5d1950993e18a6f4439254\">trucks</url> and encourage but do not require sales of new EVs to meet the new standards.</p><p>Trump has said EV manufacturing will destroy jobs in the auto industry. In recent months, however, he has softened his rhetoric, saying he’s for “a very small slice” of cars being electric.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elon-musk-x-twitter-livestream-83d6d07fc0ffef4151c96fc56aeec9ee\">change comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk</url> “endorsed me very strongly,” Trump said at an August rally in Atlanta. Even so, industry officials expect Trump to roll back Biden’s EV push and attempt to repeal tax incentives that Trump claims benefit China.</p><p>Harris has not announced an EV plan but has strongly supported EVs as vice president. At a 2022 event in Seattle, she celebrated roughly $1 billion in federal grants to purchase about 2,500 “clean” school buses. As many as 25 million children ride the familiar yellow buses each school day, and they will have a healthier future with a cleaner fleet, Harris said.</p><p>The grants and other federal climate programs not only are aimed at “saving our children, but for them, saving our planet,\\\\u2033 she said.</p><h>Climate law, jobs</h><p>Harris has focused on implementing the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-infrastructure-bill-signing-b5b8cca843133de060778f049861b144\">$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021</url>, as well as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/inflation-reduction-act-renewable-energy-policy-economy-d5b0a7f15659930c6c15f0d180b193e8\">climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act</url>, which provided nearly $375 billion in financial incentives for electric cars and clean energy projects.</p><p>Under Biden and Harris, U.S. manufacturers created more than 250,000 energy jobs last year, the Energy Department said, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-report-shows-clean-energy-jobs-grew-more-twice-rate-overall-us-employment\">clean energy accounting for more than half of those jobs</url>. “America is more energy secure than ever before with the highest domestic energy production on record,\\'\\' the Harris campaign said.</p><p>Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, deride climate spending as a \"money grab\\'\\' for environmental groups and say it will ship Americans\\' jobs to China and other countries while increasing energy prices at home.</p><p>“Kamala Harris cares more about climate change than about inflation,” Vance wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.</p><h>Goodbye Paris?</h><p>Trump, who has cast climate change as a “hoax,\" withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. He has pledged to do so again, calling the global plan to reduce carbon emissions unenforceable and a gift to China and other big polluters. Trump promises to end wind subsidies included in the climate law and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden administration to increase the energy efficiency of lightbulbs, stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.</p><p>Harris has called the Paris Agreement crucial to address climate change and protect “our children’s future.\\\\u2033</p><p>The U.S.<url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-return-paris-climate-world-leaders-ee8eb8b6744394ad41e33f94843b6586\">returned to the pact</url> soon after Biden took office in 2021.</p><h>LNG pause</h><p>After approving numerous projects to export liquefied natural gas, or LNG, the Biden administration in January <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc\">paused consideration of new natural gas export terminals</url>.

You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” Harris recollected in 2023 at a White House ceremony, clad in a mauve suit. “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p><p>At the time, the somewhat existential-sounding phrase was <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/_cingraham/status/1815117249612533803\">shared many times over</url> by critics labeling Harris as “drunk” or “crazy.”</p><p>In the past two days, online users and <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/JBPritzker/status/1815401261690208303\">politicians</url> have latched onto the clip, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/TheWapplehouse/status/1808484517000204342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1808484517000204342%7Ctwgr%5E291c122c84139d2428532d355e519551009f5e12%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Ftechnology%2F2024%2F07%2F09%2Fkamala-harris-internet-social-memes%2F\">sometimes sincerely and sometimes ironically</url>, creating <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643\">coconut-themed posts in support of her candidacy</url>.</p><p>Even Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii solidified his endorsement of Harris on X by <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/brianschatz/status/1815175570990276937\">posting a photo of himself climbing a coconut tree</url>. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/1815086635161424301\">simply posted emojis</url> for a coconut, tree and the American flag on X, too.</p><p>“Kamala has a bunch of word salad quotes that are delightfully nonsensical,” said Cory Alpert, a staffer on Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign and former Biden White House advance staffer who describes himself as “chronically online.\"</p><p>“Like you kinda know what she’s trying to say, but it doesn’t really make sense. But it’s the perfect kind of weird authenticity that works online.”</p><h>‘Brat’</h><p>Don\\'t know about “brat summer” yet? Let us help.</p><p>Younger celebs are aiming to help Harris by tying her to their viral and loyal social media brands.</p><p>Most notably, pop musician <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861\">Charli XCX posted on X</url> that “kamala IS brat,” a reference to her newly released album “brat” and its rabid summer following. The post has accumulated over 35 million impressions on the app, and Harris’ campaign quickly set its X banner photo to the striking Shrek-green color of Charli’s “brat” album cover.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@flextillerson/video/7388373417835121962\">Viral mashups of “brat” and “coconut tree” together</url> — playing Charli’s music over clips of the Harris quip — have spread widely as well on Instagram, X and TikTok.</p><p>And of course there are also the <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/MikeDelMoro/status/1815165405452714434\">green “brat” T-shirts</url> already popping up, too, as seen in X posts from Fire Island, New York.</p><h>Venn diagrams</h><p>It\\'s OK if you\\'re not a math scholar — you can still get this one.</p><p>“I love Venn diagrams,” Harris said during an event in 2022. “There\\'s just something about those three circles and the analysis of where there\\'s the intersection right?”</p><p>The Republican National Committee posted a clip of the comment on YouTube as a way to criticize Harris. But many of those commenting on the account\\'s posts expressed their own love for the set theory tool that shows overlapping areas of similarity.</p><p>Harris\\' campaign has now seized on the moment, too, with her rapid response operation <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/drmuenke/status/1815345342260666499\">posting its own Venn diagram</url> on X showing “holding Trump accountable” as the intersection of both the Biden and Harris operations.</p><h>Who\\'s the audience?</h><p>Younger voters were already slightly more in-tune with Harris over Biden, and Alpert said those already very online people are accustomed to quickly reposting and sharing content, so maybe the Harris meme moment was meant for many of them.</p><p>“The cultural gap here is really stark between Gen Z and a lot of other groups,” Alpert said. “These little moments and lines that Gen Z are picking up and running with, other groups — especially Boomers — seem to find annoying or laughable, because they want the candidate you can get a beer with.”</p><p>Younger adults — those between the ages of 18 and 29 — had a slightly more favorable view of Harris than Biden in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-poll-biden-newsom-whitmer-7ef83e5c8e510e39d7c54f7e28310064\">a July AP-NORC poll</url> conducted after the debate but before Biden announced he was withdrawing as the Democratic nominee, although a significant share said they didn’t have an opinion.</p><p>Only about one-quarter of 18-29 year-olds had a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Biden in the poll, and about 7 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion of him. By contrast, about 4 in 10 young adults had a favorable view of Harris, while about 4 in 10 had an unfavorable view and about 2 in 10 didn’t know enough to say.</p><p>A similar share of 18-29 year-olds — around 4 in 10 — had a favorable view of Trump in the July poll, while about half had an unfavorable view and about 1 in 10 didn’t know enough to say.</p><p>Schatz, the Hawaii senator who posted an image of himself climbing a coconut tree, said that while Harris is not part of Gen Z, what Gen Z wants is not necessarily a candidate their same age, but someone who is “in the pop culture mainstream.”</p><p>“We should be winning decisively among young people, and one of the impediments, frankly, was that they didn’t see anyone speaking for Democratic Party values who they found relatable,” he told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. “Politics is definitely about policy, but it’s also about vibes, and the vibes, as the kids say, are immaculate.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Yee reported from Washington.

But in the years that followed, officials routed the Interstate 610 loop with its tailpipe exhaust along one side of Pleasantville and cement plants and other heavy industry grew nearby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just days after taking office in 2021, the Biden administration made huge promises to heavily polluted Black, Latino, Indigenous and lower income areas like this, known as environmental justice communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To evaluate how well Biden and his departments delivered on these promises, The Associated Press spoke to some 30 environmental justice groups around the country, people who have been trying for years and sometimes decades to get places near their homes cleaned up — Superfund sites, petrochemical plants and diesel-burning ports, for example.</p><p>Many said this administration has done more than any previous one. With ambition not seen before they said, federal officials have solicited their advice, written stricter environmental protections and committed tens of billions of dollars in funding.</p><p>“Once he was in office, he put money where his mouth was,” said Beverly Wright, who directs the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice and sits on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. “I almost gasped when I saw the amount of money.”</p><p>But the local advocates interviewed have concerns, too. Some said <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-environment-868cf861ad9cddf67a6f7283312f8f13\">Biden administration policies have been too weak</url> to drastically reduce pollution and change their lives. Officials have even favored climate technologies that make conditions worse, they said.</p><p>Those advances could be reversed if the presidential election Nov. 5 brings in a Republican administration. Presidential nominee former President Donald Trump considers much of the regulation these groups favor to be overreach.</p><h>Environmental Wins</h><p>Pleasantville, near Houston\\'s petrochemical heartland, got a piece of Biden\\'s funds. Bridgette Murray, founder of the group Achieving Community Tasks Successfully, said residents wanted what many environmental justice groups want: data about what is in the air. Now a federal grant will help them do air testing, she said, and they can show those results to regulators.</p><p>It won\\'t actually clean the air, Murray said, “but if we don’t do anything, there will never be change.” Sustained funding will be necessary to accomplish that, she said.</p><p>The Texas grant is one of many. For each region of the country, the Environmental Protection Agency handed large amounts of money to an established group to dole out to local ones who know their communities\\' needs. In Massachusetts, for example, Boston-based nonprofit Health Resources in Action got $50 million to do this.</p><p>Dwaign Tyndal, executive director of Alternatives for Community and Environment in Roxbury, Massachusetts, which focuses on inexpensive, energy efficient buildings and harmful diesel exhaust, called this “a real, substantial investment by the federal government into community based organizations.”</p><p>Near Lake Charles in Sulphur, Louisiana, an area hard-hit by hurricanes, Roishetta Ozane feels surrounded by oil and gas facilities that she worries are responsible for some of her six children\\'s health issues, including asthma and eczema. Ozane started the Vessel Project of Louisiana, a mutual aid and disaster relief environmental justice group.</p><p>“I’m fighting for my children and for other people’s children and grandchildren to be able to safely play outside,” Ozane said, “and not be victims of climate pollution and also these climate disasters that we constantly face here.”</p><p>She wanted the administration to restrain the growth of gas facilities expanding across the Gulf Coast, and was pleased when it <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-24a7730a3b8449273fec73824ce26001\">paused new export terminals</url>.

Money went to school districts <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/electric-school-buses-diesel-exhaust-environmental-justice-4263455c7d55e34acd6f35dceb6db7c0\">for clean school buses</url>. The White House said federal <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-billions-clean-green-energy-community-grants-8f6c76cb41783a5e838ac4f7f7cce086\">“green bank” money</url> will go to thousands of projects ranging from residential heat pumps to community cooling centers.</p><p>Officials have also <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/forever-chemicals-pfas-pollution-epa-drinking-water-1c8804288413a73bb7b99fc866c8fa51\">written regulations</url> they said will <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-air-pollution-soot-biden-wildfires-d48a02362129ecda5be4d44dbd3442ed\">drastically improve public health</url>. Tighter <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/power-plants-coal-natural-gas-biden-epa-5c96ca146e7f70b47806beb4bc3713e6\">air standards</url> will reduce cancer rates, and proposed mandates to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/lead-epa-flint-discrimination-biden-white-house-ca10a72d628491fe03ec687432bf0b45\">remove harmful lead pipes</url> will prevent damage to brain development in children and lower IQ scores. The White House and EPA opened offices of environmental justice, too, and developed a way to define disadvantaged communities to help them receive benefits.</p><p>Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer, said when it comes to administration hiring, agencies with influence on native communities have been staffed with more people who are from native communities, who are tribal members. “They are helping now not only transform those agencies, but help implement these policies.”</p><p>The Biden administration came at the right time to push for these changes: Advocates had built up enough power to pressure the administration to adopt its priorities and there was broad recognition that climate change harmed the poorest communities most. Something needed to be done.</p><h>Dissatisfaction Remains</h><p>But nearly all the interviews with environmental justice groups surfaced concerns, too.</p><p>Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, which helps communities in a main petrochemical corridor, said the Biden administration listens to activists, invites them in for photo ops, but doesn’t enforce the law aggressively enough to keep the state’s Black population safe.</p><p>“When you have an EPA that basically won’t assert its authority, then a state like Louisiana that is wholly captured by industry can ignore the federal government. And that’s what they do,” Rolfes said.</p><p>EPA enforcement has increased under Biden, but Rolfes said federal officials still give the state too much power to ignore clean air rules.</p><p>Some local organizations have found it difficult to navigate the federal bureaucracy and apply for money despite technical assistance that\\'s available.</p><p>And there is anger over the Biden administration’s embrace of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/carbon-capture-removal-cop28-fossil-fuels-oil-gas-2bc53c6a8df6d337c1afcabad56377e8\">carbon capture</url> and storage technology, which collects planet-warming carbon dioxide from industrial smokestacks so it can be stored, often in underground wells. Several activists said this can extend the life of dirty facilities because it opens the door for plant operators to argue they are climate-friendly. Meanwhile, their emissions continue to harm those nearby.</p><p>These plans \"are really just perpetuating the problem of the climate crisis and keeping it a problem for future generations to have to contend with,\" said Ashley LaMont, national campaigns director for the Indigenous environmental justice organization Honor the Earth.</p><p>It\\'s a vital issue for states like Louisiana that are home to many heavy industries and want to attract new carbon capture projects. Late last year, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-epa-biden-carbon-capture-fossil-fuels-39bd36693f5acfd8455e246ae81ff67a\">EPA allowed Louisiana</url> to take over from the federal government and run its own program for granting permits for carbon capture wells. Officials incorporated some protections for residents that activists had recommended but it\\'s a move that\\'s angered many in the environmental justice community.</p><p>Federal Chief Environmental Justice Officer Jalonne White-Newsome said when Congress passed the 2021 infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, they included incentives for carbon capture. The Biden administration had to carry out the law and has invited feedback.</p><p>She said they have tried to embed environmental justice principles into the “fabric and foundation” of the federal government.</p><p>“We are not at the Promised Land yet,” she said, “but we are going there.”</p><p>A big obstacle is time. Nearly four years in, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-biden-environment-power-plant-regulations-fec31a2f2198b776c5f24d2d9f66684b\">some Biden administration programs are just beginning to distribute money</url>.</p><p>Republicans have called the EPA’s environmental justice funding a giveaway to radical left groups.</p><p>“We found that a lot of this money that’s going out really has little to do with the environment and a lot to do with funding groups that are basically engaged in what I characterize as anti-American activities,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works committee in a public statement.</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, has backed President Biden\\'s environmental justice work, saying in December that she has “put equity at the center of all of our climate investments.” A spokesperson for the Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>When it comes to Pleasantville, Murray said its problems grew from segregation and the expansion of polluting industry over many years. It will take a sustained, years-long effort to make the air healthier.</p><p>“Unfortunately when it comes to solutions, we may not have the amount of time we really need to make the big improvements,\" she said.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Matthew Daly and Matt Brown contributed from Washington D.C.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

The opposition says that its candidate, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-opposition-machado-edmundo-dbb31ef798966698ce2792b1cec74f54\">Edmundo González</url>, secured more than twice as many votes as the incumbent, and that it has voting precinct data to prove it. The council has yet to release any figures at the polling station level.</p><p>Biden and Lula — a Maduro ally — “agreed on the need for immediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data at the polling station level by the Venezuelan electoral authorities,” according to a White House statement summary of a phone call between the two leaders.</p><p>The outcome “represents a critical moment for democracy in the hemisphere,” the presidents said.</p><p>Venezuela has the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/VEN\">world’s largest proven crude reserves</url> and once boasted Latin America’s most advanced economy, but it entered into free fall after Maduro took the helm in 2013. Plummeting oil prices, widespread shortages and hyperinflation that soared past 130,000% led to social unrest and mass emigration.</p><p>More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, the largest exodus in Latin America’s recent history.</p><p>As both sides defended their claim to victory, thousands of their supporters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas.</p><p>A huge crowd of opposition supporters gathered outside the United Nations’ offices. Machado, standing atop a truck, called on the National Electoral Council to release <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-24358044cea98b3ce4f6a316bdbd3508\">the voting tally sheets</url> produced by every precinct after polls closed, saying, “Why don’t they publish them?”</p><p>Machado said the opposition coalition behind González’s candidacy won more than 84% of the tallies and she is confident he was chosen as the next president.</p><p>“The only thing we are willing to negotiate is the peaceful transition,” Machado said, as the crowd chanted: “We have no fear!”</p><p>Opposition supporters elsewhere in the city were met with tear gas Tuesday. More than 700 were arrested in nationwide protests Monday, and at last one officer was killed, according to Attorney General Tarek William Saab.</p><p>Machado and González urged their supporters to remain calm and avoid violence.</p><p>“And remember this figure, when the tally sheets are counted, yours truly will have more than 8 million votes,” González said, flanked by his wife and Machado, who has been barred from running for political office for 15 years. “We are going to begin the reconstruction of Venezuela.”</p><p>Their celebration came hours after the Organization of American States lambasted the government for not releasing the data and suggested a new election that would be monitored by international observers.</p><p>“The worst form of repression, the most vile, is to prevent the people from finding solutions through elections,” the OAS said in a statement. “The obligation of each institution in Venezuela should be to ensure freedom, justice, and transparency in the electoral process.”</p><p>Maduro\\'s closest allies came to his defense. National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez — his chief negotiator in dialogues with the U.S. and the opposition — insisted that Maduro was the indisputable winner and called the opposition violent fascists.</p><p>“Never! They will never come to power!” Rodriguez said before clapping lawmakers.</p><p>Praising the arrest of the protesters, he said Machado should also be jailed and González should be arrested “because he is the leader of the fascist conspiracy that is trying to impose itself in Venezuela.”</p><p>Diosdado Cabello, a lawmaker and ruling party leader, later said: “We are going to screw them because these people do not deserve to shed one more drop of blood for fascism.”</p><p>U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk expressed alarm over the post-election climate.</p><p>“Hundreds of people have been arrested, including children. This troubles me deeply,” he said in a statement. “I am alarmed by reports of disproportionate use of force by law enforcement officials along with violence by armed individuals supporting the Government.”</p><p>Long lines of residents started to build Tuesday outside supermarkets and other stores in Caracas in apparent anticipation of a prolonged period of demonstrations that could lead to food shortages.</p><p>In the port city of La Guaira, people <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-chavez-statues-toppled-election-be751ee4ec88ed81b141943073dd88b5\">toppled a statue</url> of Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chávez, dragged it to the street and set it on fire during Monday’s protests. Maduro unveiled the statue in 2017, and by Tuesday all that remained was its base, littered with twisted rebar and broken cement.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-machado-edmundo-crisis-115b02aa4ad25b7fb8cf583b3dd10a7f\">The election</url> was among the most peaceful in recent memory, reflecting hopes that Venezuela could avoid bloodshed and end 25 years of single-party rule. The winner would take control of an economy recovering from collapse and a population desperate for change.</p><p>“I hold you, Mr. González Urrutia, responsible for everything that is happening in Venezuela, for the criminal violence, the criminals, the wounded, the dead, the destruction,” Maduro said Tuesday during a televised meeting of the National Defense Council. “You will be directly responsible, Mr. Gonzalez Urrutia, and you, Mrs. Machado, and justice has to come, in Venezuela there has to be justice because these things cannot happen again.”</p><p>Machado told reporters that tally sheets from polling stations show Maduro had received more than 2.7 million votes while González secured roughly 6.2 million. The electoral council reported that Maduro and González garnered about 5.1 million and more than 4.4 million votes respectively.</p><p>More than 9 million people cast ballots, according to figures from electoral officials.</p><p>The number of eligible voters was estimated to be around 17 million. Another 4 million Venezuelans are registered but <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-election-migrants-maduro-opposition-hope-f37b6b4960d50b047632e96b60225ea7\">live abroad</url>, and many did not meet the requirements to register to cast ballots overseas.</p><p>As Machado and González stood atop the truck, supporters began chanting “President!

That’s more true of Democrats under 45: about three-quarters of this group say they have “a lot” or “some” trust in Harris to handle climate issues, compared to about 6 in 10 who say that about Biden. Older Democrats are more likely than younger ones to trust either Biden or Harris.</p><p>The finding is an early indication that Democrats may be making distinct evaluations of Harris when it comes to key issues, rather than seeing her as interchangeable with Biden on policy, including issues like climate change where many Democrats are anxious and want to see government action. It also reflects the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/poll-joe-biden-kamala-harris-donald-trump-1feb5ed3c2e29623ce3cec3565b487cd\">broader satisfaction Democrats have</url> with Harris as their party’s standard-bearer, and gives her an opportunity to appeal to younger Democrats, who are particularly likely to be concerned about climate change. Harris faces Republican nominee Donald Trump in the November election.</p><p>Aaron Hash, a 43-year-old Democrat and union worker, said he listened to some of Harris’ speeches after Biden stepped down and thought, “those are the right words. I’d like to see actions to follow.” He believes that the Democratic Party is “still a little bit on the back foot” compared to the Republican Party when it comes to fighting for key causes, including climate change, abortion access and gun control.</p><p>But Harris, he thinks, could change that.</p><p>“I feel hopeful that we’ll see some meaningful protections put back into place,” said Hash, who works in chemical manufacturing in Washington state. “I would like to see Democrats hopefully maintain power in the (executive branch) and then take back Congress and pass some protections that were previously protected by Chevron,” referring to the Supreme Court\\'s recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-chevron-regulations-environment-biden-536cb6a7e4bc744bbaa3f058637bbf6c\">decision that reduced the power of agencies</url> like the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>The problem of climate change is broadly recognized by Democrats. The AP-NORC poll found that 9 in 10 Democrats say climate change is happening, and most say the primary cause is human activities. About 7 in 10 Democrats say they have become more concerned about climate change over the past year. And they want to see government action on the issue: About 8 in 10 Democrats say the federal government is doing too little to reduce climate change, compared to about 6 in 10 independents and about 3 in 10 Republicans.</p><p>Younger Democrats are especially likely to feel the emotional weight of climate change. About 6 in 10 Democrats under 45 say “anxious” describes their emotions extremely or very well when they contemplate climate change, compared to about one-third of older Democrats. Younger Democrats are also less likely to say they are feeling motivated or hopeful about climate change. About 7 in 10 younger Democrats say “hopeful” describes their emotions as either “not very” or “not at all” well, compared to 45% of older Democrats.</p><p>Alex Campbell, a 29-year-old Democrat in Philadelphia, said there is “a lot of existential dread” among Millennials and Gen Z about what the world will look like in 50 years. Campbell gives Biden credit for <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-climate-health-tax-law-economy-inflation-f112d7c78abaa724d22964317d213deb\">passing the Inflation Reduction Act</url>, and he thinks Harris would expand on those efforts. He hopes that by having a younger Democrat at the top of the ticket, she might care more about the importance of addressing climate change immediately.</p><p>But Campbell is pessimistic that, even if elected, Harris could make significant progress on climate change without Democratic control of Congress. Like other Democrats, Campbell worries about the role of the Supreme Court in further eroding environmental protections.</p><p>“I would probably have more hope with Harris,” Campbell said. “Because she is younger, I think she will be more aggressive in her policy proposals. But at the end of the day, if there’s no House and Senate that are going to pass these bills, it doesn’t really matter.”</p><p>About half of Americans say the outcome of the presidential election in November will be extremely or very important for the issue of climate change — and the issue of climate change is especially resonant for Democrats. About three-quarters of Democrats say the result of the 2024 election will matter for climate change, compared to 44% of independents and about 2 in 10 Republicans. Older Democrats are slightly more likely than younger ones to say this election is extremely or very important for climate change.</p><p>Nikolas Ostergard, a 21-year-old construction worker in Utah, said he thinks Harris is a stronger communicator than Biden is, and he believes that will allow her to make “an even better impact” on issues that matter to Democrats, including climate change. As a Democrat who will participate in his first presidential election in November, Ostergard is still waiting to hear Harris articulate her own environmental policy plans. He is hopeful that she “will listen more” to the public than Biden did.</p><p>“At first, I thought it wasn’t going to be much better with (Harris) because she was Biden’s vice president. But, it does seem like she is taking different approaches, so my hope has gone up,” Ostergard said. “My hope for Harris’ policies is better than it was for Biden’s. And definitely way over my hope for Trump’s policies.”</p><p>___</p><p>The poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’” Harris recollected in 2023 at a White House ceremony, clad in a mauve suit. “You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p><p>At the time, the somewhat existential-sounding phrase was shared many times over by critics labeling Harris as “drunk” or “crazy.”</p><p>In the past two days, online users and <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/JBPritzker/status/1815401261690208303\">politicians</url> have latched onto the clip, sometimes sincerely and sometimes ironically, creating <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643\">coconut-themed posts</url>\\xa0<url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/TheWapplehouse/status/1808484517000204342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1808484517000204342%7Ctwgr%5E291c122c84139d2428532d355e519551009f5e12%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Ftechnology%2F2024%2F07%2F09%2Fkamala-harris-internet-social-memes%2F\">in support</url>\\xa0<url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/_cingraham/status/1815117249612533803\">of her candidacy</url>.</p><p>Even Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii solidified his endorsement of Harris on X by <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/brianschatz/status/1815175570990276937\">posting a photo of himself climbing a coconut tree</url>. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/1815086635161424301\">simply posted emojis</url> for a coconut, tree and the American flag on X, too.</p><p>“Kamala has a bunch of word salad quotes that are delightfully nonsensical,” said Cory Alpert, a staffer on Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign and former Biden White House advance staffer who describes himself as “chronically online.\"</p><p>“Like you kinda know what she’s trying to say, but it doesn’t really make sense. But it’s the perfect kind of weird authenticity that works online.”</p><h>“brat”</h><p>Don\\'t know about “brat summer” yet? Let us help.</p><p>Younger celebs are aiming to help Harris by tying her to their viral and loyal social media brands.</p><p>Most notably, pop musician <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/charli_xcx/status/1815182384066707861\">Charli XCX posted on X</url> that “kamala IS brat,” a reference to her newly released album “brat” and its rabid summer following. The post has accumulated over 35 million impressions on the app, and Harris’ campaign quickly set its X banner photo to the striking Shrek-green color of Charli’s “brat” album cover.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@flextillerson/video/7388373417835121962\">Viral mashups of “brat” and “cocount tree” together</url> — playing Charli’s music over clips of the Harris quip — have spread widely as well on Instagram, X and TikTok.</p><p>And of course there are also the <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/MikeDelMoro/status/1815165405452714434\">green “brat” T-shirts</url> already popping up, too, as seen in X posts from Fire Island, New York.</p><h>Venn diagrams</h><p>It\\'s OK if you\\'re not a math scholar — you can still get this one.</p><p>“I love Venn diagrams,” Harris said during an event in 2022. “There\\'s just something about those three circles and the analysis of where there\\'s the intersection right?”</p><p>The Republican National Committee posted a clip of the comment on YouTube as a way to criticize Harris. But many of those commenting on the account\\'s posts expressed their own love for the set theory tool that shows overlapping areas of similarity.</p><p>Harris\\' campaign has now seized on the moment, too, with her rapid response operation <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/drmuenke/status/1815345342260666499\">posting its own Venn diagram</url> on X showing “holding Trump accountable” as the intersection of both the Biden and Harris operations.</p><h>Who\\'s the audience?</h><p>Younger voters were already slightly more in-tune with Harris over Biden, and Alpert said those already very online people are accustomed to quickly reposting and sharing content, so maybe the Harris meme moment was meant for many of them.</p><p>“The cultural gap here is really stark between Gen Z and a lot of other groups,” Alpert said. “These little moments and lines that Gen Z are picking up and running with, other groups — especially Boomers — seem to find annoying or laughable, because they want the candidate you can get a beer with.”</p><p>Younger adults — those between the ages of 18 and 29 — had a slightly more favorable view of Harris than Biden in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-poll-biden-newsom-whitmer-7ef83e5c8e510e39d7c54f7e28310064\">a July AP-NORC poll</url> conducted after the debate but before Biden announced he was withdrawing as the Democratic nominee, although a significant share said they didn’t have an opinion.</p><p>Only about one-quarter of 18-29 year-olds had a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Biden in the poll, and about 7 in 10 had an unfavorable opinion of him. By contrast, about 4 in 10 young adults had a favorable view of Harris, while about 4 in 10 had an unfavorable view and about 2 in 10 didn’t know enough to say.</p><p>A similar share of 18-29 year-olds — around 4 in 10 — had a favorable view of Trump in the July poll, while about half had an unfavorable view and about 1 in 10 didn’t know enough to say.</p><p>Schatz, the Hawaii senator who posted an image of himself climbing a coconut tree, said that while Harris is not part of Gen Z, what Gen Z wants is not necessarily a candidate their same age, but someone who is “in the pop culture mainstream.”</p><p>“We should be winning decisively among young people, and one of the impediments, frankly, was that they didn’t see anyone speaking for Democratic Party values who they found relatable,” he told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. “Politics is definitely about policy, but it’s also about vibes, and the vibes, as the kids say, are immaculate.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Yee reported from Washington.

Millions of Black people were proud of Obama’s candidacy even as they feared he wouldn’t be accepted by Americans overall.</p><p>Cyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden\\'s decision “heartbreaking.” As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumor.</p><p>“I\\'m nervous. I\\'m really nervous,” Adams said.</p><p>Biden’s support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.</p><p>“People really don’t like women, especially Black women,” said Mary Jameson, 46. “If a white woman can’t win, how can a Black woman win?”</p><p>Carrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.</p><p>“With me being a Black woman, I understand that she’s at the intersection of sexism and racism,” Jackson said. “I think now that’s going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump’s supporters.”</p><p>An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden’s announcement Sunday found <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-poll-biden-newsom-whitmer-7ef83e5c8e510e39d7c54f7e28310064\">about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president</url>. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.</p><p>But Black people were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.</p><p>In a show of enthusiasm about the vice president, more than 40,000 Black women participated in a Zoom meeting Sunday organized by a group called #WinWithBlackWomen. The call was held just hours after Biden’s announcement and participants raised more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign.</p><p>Many Democrats followed Biden’s lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it “fully backs” the vice president.</p><p>And some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden’s dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.</p><p>“If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,” said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.</p><p>The AP-NORC polling shows <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-black-hispanic-americans-voters-of-color-59acadcda6cf9cb1082d4bdd9d4c4a81\">Black people generally view Trump negatively</url>. But while about 7 in 10 Black adults have an unfavorable view of Trump, his numbers have improved notably since early 2021.</p><p>Trump\\'s campaign has sought to win over more Black voters and members of other minorities.</p><p>Anaya Bridges, a 22-year-old student at Georgia State University, said she believed “some people have been swayed” by Republican outreach to communities of color, and she is concerned about voter turnout.</p><p>“The timing is terrible,” she said of Biden\\'s announcement.</p><p>Jon Diggs, a 40-year-old Atlanta therapist who has generally voted Democratic in past elections, said he was shocked by Biden\\'s decision. Both parties, Diggs said, have work to do.</p><p>“I don’t think that either party has done a good job for the middle class and particularly the middle-class African American person,” he said.</p><p>Johnny Bester, a 37-year-old from Atlanta who was riding a scooter alongside Diggs in Piedmont Park, said he was “not loyal to any brand” of politics. He said Biden should have dropped out long ago and that he wasn\\'t a fan of the president\\'s endorsement of Harris.</p><p>“A lot of us forgot that she was even in the office, because she hasn’t been too vocal. She hasn’t been too visible,” Bester said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-e068b36f765cbaa711d1fab3d38769f120240722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CJ5-F1H1-JC5B-G0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><timeReceived>11:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 22, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The poll was conducted mostly before Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. It’s unclear whether the shooting influenced people’s views of Biden, but the small number of poll interviews completed after the shooting provided no early indication that his prospects improved.</p><p>Meanwhile, as Vice President Kamala Harris receives additional scrutiny amid the talk about whether Biden should bow out, the poll found that her favorability rating is similar to his — but the share of Americans who have an unfavorable opinion of her is slightly lower.</p><p>The poll provides some evidence that Black Democrats are among Biden’s strongest supporters, with roughly half in the survey saying he should continue running, compared to about 3 in 10 white and Hispanic Democrats. Overall, seven in 10 Americans think Biden should drop out, with Democrats only slightly less likely than Republicans and independents to say that he should make way for a new nominee.</p><p>___</p><p>Prominent Democrat Schiff calls for Biden to withdraw: Democrats aim to nominate before convention</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — California Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the highest-profile Democrat to call for President Joe Biden to drop his reelection bid, even as the party pushed ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August.</p><p>The move to schedule the roll call, which would come weeks before the Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19, follows nearly 20 Democratic members of Congress calling on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican former President Donald Trump last month.</p><p>Among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll — sharply undercutting Biden\\'s post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him even if some “big names” are turning on him.</p><p>“While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement. “And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.”</p><p>Schiff is a prominent Democrat on his own, and his statement will also be watched because of his proximity to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>___</p><p>House Oversight panel subpoenas Secret Service director to testify on Trump assassination attempt</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to the Secret Service director compelling her to appear before the committee on Monday for what is scheduled to be the first congressional hearing into the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.</p><p>And even before the first hearing Republican calls for Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign intensified Wednesday with top Republican leaders from both the House and the Senate saying she should step down. The director has said she has no intention of resigning.</p><p>Rep. James Comer said initially that the Secret Service committed to her attendance but that Homeland Security officials appear to have intervened and there has been no “meaningful updates or information” shared with the committee.</p><p>Comer said the “lack of transparency and failure to cooperate” with the committee called into question Cheatle\\'s ability to lead the Secret Service and necessitates the subpoena.</p><p>Cheatle has said the agency understands the importance of a review ordered by Democratic President Joe Biden and would fully participate in it as well as with congressional committees looking into the shooting.</p><p>___</p><p>JD Vance will get his political introduction at the RNC as Trump\\'s running mate</p><p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — Introducing himself to the nation, Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance is ready to use his Wednesday night address at the Republican National Convention to share the story of his hardscrabble upbringing and make the case that it\\'s the GOP ticket that best understands the challenges facing many Americans.</p><p>The 39-year-old Ohio senator is a relative political unknown. In his first primetime speech since becoming Trump\\'s nominee for vice president, he will recount growing up poor in Kentucky and Ohio, his mother addicted to drugs and his father absent, and how he later went on to the highest levels of U.S. politics.</p><p>It’s a story meant to connect with voters in middle America and show how Vance’s upbringing shaped his positions on issues such as immigration, inflation and drugs, according to a person familiar with the speech who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.</p><p>Speaking at a fundraiser earlier Wednesday in Milwaukee, Vance also said he will use his headlining address to drive home the call for the former president to be reelected.</p><p>“The guy who actually connects with working people in this country is not Fake Scranton Joe, it’s Real President Donald Trump,” Vance said, referencing President Joe Biden.</p><p>___</p><p>Judge\\'s order dismissing Trump classified docs case won\\'t be final word as long court fight awaits</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge\\'s stunning decision to dismiss the classified documents case against Donald Trump brought an abrupt halt to what experts have considered the strongest and most straightforward of the prosecutions of the former president. But it\\'s hardly the final word.</p><p>Special counsel Jack Smith\\'s appeal of U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon\\'s order is expected to tee up a court fight that might reach the U.S. Supreme Court and could result in the reinstatement of the indictment and even conceivably the reassignment of the case to a different judge.</p><p>There’s no scenario in which a revived prosecution could reach trial before the November election — and it presumably won’t take place at all in the event Trump is elected president and orders his Justice Department to dismiss it. Still, Cannon’s order ensures many more months of legal wrangling in a criminal case that became snarled over the last year by interminable delays.</p><p>“The only good thing about this is that it is finally a decision,” said Nancy Gertner, a former federal judge in Massachusetts who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. “The difficulty with Judge Cannon has been that she has made no decisions. She has simply sat on the case. And since she has made no decisions, there was nothing to appeal.\"</p><p>The judge\\'s 93-page order held that Smith\\'s selection as special counsel violated the Constitution because he was named to the position directly by Attorney General Merrick Garland instead of being appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Prosecutors vigorously challenged that argument when it was raised by Trump\\'s lawyers, and filed a formal notice of appeal Wednesday to initiate the process.</p><p>___</p><p>US military pier for carrying aid to Gaza will be dismantled after weather and security problems</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military-built pier to carry humanitarian aid to Gaza will be dismantled and brought home, ending a mission that has been fraught with repeated weather and security problems that limited how much food and other supplies could get to starving Palestinians.</p><p>Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, told reporters in a Pentagon briefing on Wednesday that the pier achieved its intended effect in what he called an “unprecedented operation.”</p><p>As the U.S. military steps away from the sea route for humanitarian aid, questions swirl about Israel’s new plan to use the port at Ashdod as a substitute. There are few details on how it will work and lingering concerns about whether aid groups will have enough viable land crossings to get assistance into the territory besieged by war between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>Cooper said the Ashdod corridor will be more sustainable and it has already been used to get more than a million pounds of aid into Gaza.</p><p>“Having now delivered the largest volume of humanitarian assistance ever into the Middle East, we’re now mission complete and transitioning to a new phase,” said Cooper. \"In the coming weeks, we expect that millions of pounds of aid will enter into Gaza via this new pathway.”</p><p>___</p><p>Syrian official who oversaw prison where alleged abuse took place arrested by US officials</p><p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A former Syrian military official who oversaw a prison where human rights officials say torture and abuse routinely took place has been arrested in Los Angeles, court documents show.</p><p>Samir Ousman al-Sheikh, 72, was taken into custody last week at Los Angeles International Airport on immigration fraud charges, specifically that he denied on his U.S. visa and citizenship applications that he had ever persecuted anyone in Syria, according to a criminal complaint filed on July 9. Investigators are considering additional charges, the complaint shows.</p><p>Al-Sheikh was in charge of Syria’s infamous Adra Prison from 2005 to 2008 under President Bashar Assad. Human rights groups and United Nations officials have accused the Syrian government of widespread abuses in its detention facilities, including torture and arbitrary detention of thousands of people, in many cases without informing their families about their fate. Many remain missing and are presumed to have died or been executed.</p><p>“This is the highest-level Assad regime official arrested anywhere in the world. ... This is a really big deal,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, said Wednesday.</p><p>Moustafa said one of his staff members, a former Syrian detainee, was first tipped off in 2022 by a refugee that there was “potentially a war criminal” in the United States. His organization alerted several federal agencies and began working with them to build a case against Al-Sheikh.</p><p>___</p><p>Navy exonerates 256 Black sailors unjustly punished in 1944 after a deadly California port explosion</p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Navy has exonerated 256 Black sailors who were found to be unjustly punished in 1944 following a horrific port explosion that killed hundreds of service members and exposed racist double standards among the then-segregated ranks.</p><p>On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo ship detonated, causing secondary blasts that ignited 5,000 tons (4,535 metric tonnes) of explosives at Port Chicago naval weapons station near San Francisco.</p><p>The explosion killed 320 sailors and civilians, nearly 75% of whom were Black, and injured another 400 personnel. Surviving Black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while white officers were granted leave to recuperate.</p><p>The pier was a critical ammunition supply site for forces in the Pacific during World War II, and the job of loading those ships was left primarily to Black enlisted sailors overseen by white officers.</p><p>Before the explosion, the Black sailors working the dock had expressed concerns about the loading operations. Shortly after the blast, they were ordered to return to loading ships even though no changes had been made to improve their safety.</p><p>___</p><p>Storms flood the Ozarks and strand drivers in Toronto. New York community is devastated by tornado</p><p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Another wave of severe storms pummeled a wide swath of the United States and Canada, leading to flash floods and water rescues Wednesday in the Ozark Mountains, dropping a tornado that ravaged a community in upstate New York and stranding drivers in high water around Toronto.</p><p>The relentless series of storms has caused deaths or damage from the Plains to New England this week.

Trump also will appear on the ballot in Florida, which canceled its Democratic primary. Neither candidate faces strong challenges, although “None of the Names Shown” will be a ballot option for both primaries in Kansas.</p><p>Further down the ballot, California and Ohio will hold special primaries to fill vacancies in the narrowly divided House. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/california-special-election-congress-mccarthy-fong-boudreaux-4d2cb8c2195129051ed66a0d56398385\">California’s 20th District</url>, nine candidates are competing to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-house-seat-special-election-newsom-83ad142695dc5f433eb6f97a3b5e6e82\">replace former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</url>, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/kevin-mccarthy-house-speaker-reelection-84fc76226de7d20e140325bbe87622c8\">resigned in December</url> following his <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-3542dd134dccf35bc67db3463baec53b\">ouster from the speakership</url> by members of his own party. All candidates run on the same ballot regardless of party, and, if no one receives a majority of the vote on Tuesday, the top two finishers will advance to a May special general election. The winner will serve out the rest of McCarthy’s term. A separate primary was held on March 5 for the full term that begins in January 2025. Republicans Vince Fong, a state Assemblyman, and Mike Boudreaux, the Tulare County sheriff, advanced to the November ballot. They are also competing in Tuesday’s special primary.</p><p>In Ohio\\'s 6th Congressional District, voters will choose the nominees to replace former Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, who resigned in January to become the president of Youngstown State University. Three Republicans and two Democrats are competing in both a special election to fill the remainder of Johnson’s term as well as the regularly scheduled primary for the full term. The winner of the special election will advance to a special general election on June 11.</p><p>Ohio Republicans will also decide a competitive U.S. Senate primary featuring state Sen. Matt Dolan, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and businessman Bernie Moreno, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-senate-ohio-trump-moreno-e5a12563de717b6a572595ba6fe6674b\">has Trump’s backing</url>. Dolan has the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-senate-ohio-dewine-trump-dolan-1a49f2406367e1e2f644b8e5d37eb265\">endorsement of Gov. Mike DeWine</url> and former Sen. Rob Portman and was the only candidate in his primary who didn’t actively court Trump’s endorsement. The winner will face Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in one of the key races for control of the chamber this fall.</p><p>Illinois will also hold state primaries Tuesday besides the presidential contests. Three incumbent members of Congress face competitive challenges from within their parties. In the 4th Congressional District, Democratic Rep. Chuy García faces Alderman Raymond Lopez. In the 7th District, Rep. Danny Davis is part of a crowded field that includes Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin, community organizer Kina Collins and two others. In the 12th District, Republican Rep. Mike Bost has a challenge from former state Sen. Darren Bailey.</p><h>DECISION NOTES</h><p>In the presidential race, Biden and Trump are the favorites in their primaries as neither faces strong challenges. The first indications that they are winning statewide on a level consistent with the overwhelming margins seen in most other contests held this year may be sufficient to determine the statewide winners.</p><p>In the California special congressional election, the results of the March 5 primary for the full-term seat provide a useful point of comparison, since both races included the same major candidates. Fong was the top finisher on March 5, with Boudreaux a distant second and Democrat Marisa Wood close behind in third place. A candidate can win the seat on Tuesday by receiving more than 50% of the vote. Otherwise, the top two finishers will advance to a special general election in May. This could delay determining who won the race. If the leading candidate hovers near the 50% mark, the race might not be called until additional votes are counted, even if the front-runner leads the rest of the field by a significant margin. The Associated Press will either declare a winner if a candidate has clearly received more than 50% of the vote or declare that no candidate has received a majority and identify which two candidates will advance to the May special election.</p><p>Here are the March 19 contests at a glance:</p><h>DELEGATES AT STAKE ON MARCH 19</h><p>Democrats: 379</p><p>Republicans: 350</p><h>STATES WITH PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS (5)</h><p>Arizona, Florida (Republican only), Illinois, Kansas, Ohio</p><h>DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS (4)</h><p>STATE-RUN PRIMARIES (4): Arizona, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio</p><h>REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS (5)</h><p>STATE-RUN PRIMARIES (5): Arizona, Florida (Republican only), Illinois, Kansas, Ohio</p><h>STATES WITH PRIMARIES FOR STATE &amp; LOCAL OFFICES (3)</h><p>California, Illinois, Ohio</p><h>TUESDAY TIMELINE</h><p>7 p.m. EDT: Most polls close in Florida</p><p>7:30 p.m. EDT: All polls close in Ohio</p><p>8 p.m. EDT: All polls close in Illinois; last polls close in Florida; most polls close in Kansas</p><p>9 p.m. EDT: Last polls close in Kansas; first polls close in Arizona</p><p>10 p.m. EDT: Most polls close in Arizona</p><p>11 p.m. EDT: All polls close in California</p><h>ARIZONA</h><p>PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY (D): Biden, Gabriel Cornejo, Frankie Lozada, Stephen Lyons, Jason Palmer, Dean Phillips, Marianne Williamson. 72 delegates at stake</p><p>PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY (R): Trump, Ryan Binkley, John Castro, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, David Stuckenberg, Vivek Ramaswamy. 43 delegates at stake</p><p>WHO CAN VOTE: Voters registered with a party may only participate in their own party’s primary.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, supports the bill, and on Wednesday issued a statement urging the Senate to pass it. But it faces long odds in the Republican-controlled chamber.</p><p>Under the bill, county election workers could begin processing ballots up to seven days before Election Day.</p><p>Counties have sought that kind of a provision for years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/46bf3a1171c6485387d9b9e1c94a5589\">even before</url> 2020\\'s presidential election, to give them more time to process mail-in ballots and avoid a drawn-out post-election count.</p><p>Nearly every state allows time before Election Day for workers to process mail-in ballots. Currently, Pennsylvania doesn\\'t let counties begin processing mail-in ballots before Election Day.</p><p>The County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania backed the bill, saying that having more time to process mail-in ballots before polls close — called “precanvassing” — will help them manage the workload and ensure quicker results.</p><p>“This simple change would significantly improve election administration without compromising ballot security,” Lisa Schaefer, the association’s executive director, said in a statement.</p><p>Schaefer asked the Senate to quickly advance the bill to Shapiro so that it can be implemented for November’s general election.</p><p>But Senate GOP Majority Leader Joe Pittman insisted Wednesday that Pennsylvania must toughen voter identification requirements as a companion to any legislation on election administration — a demand Republicans have made <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pennsylvania-house-elections-elections-government-and-politics-e3d6bbd3fcc61d745be8ea768a04f1c5\">since 2021</url>.</p><p>Democrats have opposed such a change, saying there is scant record of in-person voting fraud and that it will only prevent some registered voters from voting.</p><p>A surge in mail-in ballots in 2020’s presidential election shined a spotlight on Pennsylvania’s requirement after it took four days of counting for news agencies <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-pennsylvania-elections-48ecc3dfb11a91020aef5dc3fb8d22de\">to project Biden as the winner</url> of Pennsylvania, giving him the electoral votes necessary to win the White House.</p><p>However, Trump and his allies tried to exploit the days it took after polls closed to tabulate the millions of mail-in ballots to spread <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d\">baseless conspiracy theories</url> and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election.</p><p>Republicans revived those claims during Wednesday\\'s nearly hourlong floor debate.</p><p>“Under this legislation, they’ll take votes from anyone, anytime, anywhere, legal or not,” Rep. Martina White, a Republican from Philadelphia, said during floor debate.</p><p>One Republican lawmaker referred back to baseless claims that partisans in Philadelphia, a Democratic bastion, shut down vote-counting to falsify enough mail-in ballots for Biden after polls closed to overcome Trump’s advantage among those voting in-person at polling places.</p><p>“This vote will take us back in the days where cities close with one leader for president and opened again with another,” said Rep. Eric Nelson, a Republican from Westmoreland.</p><p>House Majority Leader Matt Bradford, a Democrat from Montgomery, said it is shameless to suggest that the legislation is partisan and that lawmakers should pass it to help guarantee a timely and accurate election result while avoiding a repeat of 2020.</p><p>“This is simply about giving people a timely result in an election so we don’t have what we had in 2020,” Bradford said during floor debate. “The mindless conspiracies. The election denialism. I’ve heard so much over the last 20 minutes of debate that remind me so much of the horrible months that followed the November 2020 election.”</p><p>In 2020, 2.65 million ballots were cast by mail in Pennsylvania, the nation’s fifth-most populous state, or almost 40% of the total.</p><p>Republicans have been hostile toward mail-in voting since Trump in early 2020 began baselessly smearing it as rife with fraud.</p><p>At least partly as a result, the majority of mail-in ballots — usually about 70% — are cast by registered Democrats in Pennsylvania and the majority of in-person voting on Election Day is done by registered Republicans.</p><p>In the days and weeks after 2020’s election, Trump and his allies filed lawsuits to try to throw out mail-in ballots and keep Trump in power by overturning Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Republicans have repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-mail-voting-ballots-election-f89185f22e93df5817c653862b8ab219\">gone to court</url> since then to try to invalidate Pennsylvania’s mail-in voting law.</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Marc Levy at <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/timelywriter\">twitter.com/timelywriter</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-d32de8587638dd4bc842e43e08ad7c4220240501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXP-KSX1-DYMD-641W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"805\"/><timeReceived>10:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 1, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In just the last week, voters in South Africa who are reeling from deep poverty, inequality and unemployment handed <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-election-vote-anc-d9da7582ca98a4e00fec2da6a5fe1e91\">a historic defeat</url> to the African National Congress, which lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since apartheid ended 30 years ago. In Latin America alone, leaders and their parties had lost 20 elections in a row until this past weekend\\'s presidential election in Mexico, according to a tally by Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor of government.</p><p>The dynamic is likely to repeat itself as the European Union launches its legislative elections this week, where conservative populist parties are expected to register gains across the continent. EU parliamentary elections are usually an opportunity for voters in individual countries to vent their frustrations because the candidates they elect will have power in Brussels rather than their own national capitals. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called elections for later this summer in which his party is expected to struggle.</p><p>“In many ways we\\'ve never had it so good, objectively speaking, and yet people are so unsatisfied,” said Matthias Matthijs, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C.</p><h>ECONOMY, CULTURE AND POLITICS FUELING ANGER</h><p>The reasons for the dissatisfaction are many, from social media\\'s ability to magnify problems to the painful recovery from the coronavirus pandemic to the backlash toward economic and cultural changes sparked by globalization and mass immigration.</p><p>Though in places like Europe, the populist right has notched several gains and is <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-eu-election-far-right-1c9bba84aa8ace2619c307b933385473\">expected to make more</url>, there is little ideological consistency globally to the unhappiness. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/global-democracy-poll-government-politics-autocracy-bad95f3d53d0bb2c8d244f344654d1c7\">a recent Pew poll across 24 democracies</url>, a median of 74% of respondents said they didn\\'t think politicians cared what people like them think, and 42% said no political party represented their viewpoint.</p><p>“It\\'s about economics and culture, but it\\'s also about the functioning of politics itself,” said Richard Wike, managing director of Pew\\'s Global Attitudes Research, citing polarization of voters into warring camps. “It can lead to a situation where politics is seen as a zero-sum game. People see more of an existential threat from the other side, and that makes people unhappy about democracy.”</p><p>Experts say there is one notable exception to the trend of global anger with elected leaders — places where the leaders are anti-establishment, populist strongmen of all ideological persuasions.</p><p>“Antisystem outsider, populist figures are winning more than in the past,” Levitsky said. “Whether they constitute any movement is unclear to me.”</p><p>In Mexico, leftist President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is termed out but broke the streak of losses for Latin American leaders\\' parties as his hand-picked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, won <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-elections-president-lopez-obrador-cd48b3951845b0acb09da4ec5de8a91b\">Sunday\\'s presidential election</url>. In Argentina, newly elected president Javier Milei, a self-described “anarcho-capitalist” dubbed “the madman” by admirers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/milei-100-days-argentina-poverty-inflation-6011d71963b4203accbfadb4044cd43e\">remains popular</url> despite the country\\'s crippling economic problems that have persisted following his austerity and deregulation reforms.</p><p>“I was never interested in politics because nothing ever changed,” said Sebastian Sproviero, a 37-year-old engineer at a Buenos Aires concert that featured Milei belting out rock anthems. “Now it has.”</p><p>In India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticized for eroding the world’s most populous democracy, the Pew poll found the country had the highest support among all surveyed countries for a more authoritarian form of government, with two-thirds of respondents there backing a strong leader system of government.</p><h>WARNING SIGNS FOR DEMOCRACY</h><p>Still, even some of the more authoritarian governments such as Modi\\'s have had to deal with dissatisfaction with the status quo. <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-election-results-2024-lok-sabha-modi-bjp-7893efecc83fa8225a611f174e6420ee\">Modi appears to have won</url> his third term as India’s prime minister in national elections that wrapped up Tuesday, but his conservative Hindu nationalist party had an underwhelming showing and will likely need to join a coalition to form a government.</p><p>In Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has stocked the judiciary and media with loyalists and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/hungary-gay-rights-european-union-6a87b83de47bb90b12e4927735d8092f\">revised the country\\'s constitution</url> to favor his party, a former member of his Fidesz party, Péter Magyar, has emerged as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-election-magyar-fidesz-russia-f53cd35e52a9f91c34b00d8dd6f85694\">new, increasingly popular</url> critic and challenger.</p><p>“More and more people in Hungary are increasingly feeling this antiestablishment desire,” said Péter Ember as he attended one of Magyar’s recent demonstrations in Budapest. “We really want to reform this existing political culture, from the opposition to the ruling party. We want a new one, and we want people that work for us.”</p><p>The global anti-incumbent mood, coupled with the success of antiestablishment populists, comes amid several warning signs for the health of democracy. The Pew poll found democracy\\'s appeal slipping, even as it remained the preferred system of government around the world. Freedom House, a Washington-based organization that promotes democracy, said its “Freedom Index” measuring democratic health globally has declined for 18 straight years.</p><p>Adrian Shahbaz, a vice president at Freedom House, attributed the erosion of support to a series of crises since the turn of the century, including the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in the U.S., the 2008-09 global recession and the coronavirus pandemic. Adding to the stress, he said, is the increasing focus on identity issues such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/transgender-puberty-blockers-england-uk-5ed81979363470028053423c0a2fa263\">transgender policies</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/eu-migration-pact-asylum-borders-elections-44abb9c1fa1f2c7a8385167770bb5379\">immigration</url> in democratic politics, especially in Europe and the U.S.</p><p>“The key cleavages in democracies tend to be around identity issues rather than economic ones,” Shahbaz said. “That in itself can be very risky because democracy depends on a civil identity that goes beyond tribal identifications.”</p><p>Still, the picture is not all gloom for democracy. The anti-incumbent fervor also helped spur some victories for people\\'s rights to choose their own leaders.</p><p>In Senegal in March, voters selected <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/senegal-presidential-election-results-bd394a4849b3711712244f28f0b1de58\">a new president</url> after the incumbent <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/senegal-presidential-election-vote-polls-africa-0270e1952d35513b594d1c9b4822e158\">unsuccessfully tried to postpone</url> the election. In Guatemala last year, Bernardo Arévalo, a sociologist and anticorruption crusader, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/guatemala-0b8d5eb5dbc81fcb6a413f8212739b68\">won the country\\'s presidential election</url> despite efforts by the incumbent party to block certification of his victory.</p><h>DISCONTENT RUNS DEEP IN THE U.S.</h><p>One of the greatest tests comes in the U.S. in November when voters will decide whether to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-president-election-six-months-uncertainty-12e52060e54c8f48be001d159f4a4dcb\">stay with Biden or return Trump</url> to the White House. The former president unsuccessfully tried to overturn <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/election-claims-biden-won-explained-bd53b14ce871412b462cb3fe2c563f18\">his 2020 election loss</url>, leading to <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-confirm-joe-biden-78104aea082995bbd7412a6e6cd13818\">the attack on the U.S. Capitol</url> on Jan. 6, 2021, and two of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/projects/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/\">the four criminal cases</url> he\\'s currently facing. Biden, meanwhile, is hampered by <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-immigration-economy-inflation-abortion-21b95914866c2af3a1e7af8e302dbe27\">an unenthusiastic public</url> — 61% of adults did not approve of his performance in office in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/few-excited-many-angry-and-fearful-about-biden-trump-reelection/\">an AP-NORC poll</url> taken in March. A CNN poll found 53% of registered voters were unhappy with the choice between Biden and Trump.</p><p>The low poll numbers frustrate many Biden advisers given the U.S. economy\\'s relatively strong recent performance compared with the rest of the world. But international pollsters say the U.S. shows particularly stark signs of polarization and unhappiness. The Pew poll identified sharper levels of polarization in the U.S. than in most other democracies. The Gallup Organization found that the U.S. ranks at or near the bottom in confidence in its institutions among the wealthy G7 countries.</p><p>One of the few things that unites U.S. voters is frustration over their choices in <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/elections\">this fall\\'s presidential contest</url>, a relic of the country\\'s winner-take-all constitutional system, which naturally devolves into competitions between two major political parties fought in the few states where the Electoral College votes are up for grabs.</p><p>“I’m angry, but it’s like, what is the solution to my anger? Who am I going to vote for is a great question because the answer is I really don’t know, to be quite honest,\" said Kenji Takada-Dill, a 30-year-old video editor in Seattle. \"We’ve known for a long time that the two-party system doesn’t work. None of the candidates represent my beliefs or my values.”</p><p>In Greeley, a city of 112,000 that lies on Colorado\\'s plains 60 miles northeast of Denver, Otto, the craft store owner, said she probably leans conservative but has long tried to ignore politics. That\\'s proved harder since she started using social media to promote her business, where the country\\'s nasty partisan feuds have leaked into her feeds as she promotes ceramics classes and youth programs.</p><p>Stepping into the store with her two children, Kristina McGuffey, 41, also bemoaned the increasing toxicity of U.S. politics.</p><p>“I just love the way America was founded, one nation under God,” McGuffey said. “We\\'ve become people who, when we don\\'t get our way, we throw a hissy fit.”</p><p>___</p><p>Riccardi reported from Denver, DeBre from Buenos Aires and Kirka from London.

But by the campaign\\'s own admission, at least half of those states have not verified that his submission is valid.</p><p>CNN has signaled that it won\\'t count states where Kennedy has applied for ballot access but not been confirmed. Kennedy filed a Federal Election Commission complaint last month alleging the cable network is colluding with Democratic President <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</url> and presumptive Republican nominee <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</url> to exclude him from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8\">debate</url>.</p><p>Kennedy also has not met the debate\\'s requirement to get at least 15% in four reputable polls.</p><p>Biden and Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/2024-election-presidential-debates-biden-trump-6b1d1dbb2ed61c7637041b23662d7da8\">agreed</url> to the CNN debate and a second on Sept. 10 hosted by ABC, bypassing the nonpartisan commission that has organized debates for nearly four decades.</p><p>Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and prominent anti-vaccine activist, abandoned his Democratic primary challenge to Biden last year and began campaigning as an independent. Among the major obstacles he faces is an expensive and time-consuming requirement to secure ballot access state by state, which will require him to collect millions of signatures that must be verified by election officials before his candidacy is approved.</p><p>He\\'s <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-rfk-independent-phoenix-ce8ef411c13bb7d5fc4ddff198cbbac9\">built a loyal following</url> among people disaffected by American institutions including the government, corporations and the media, an ideologically eclectic group that will have an unpredictable impact on the election. Biden and Trump both fear that Kennedy will draw voters who might otherwise vote for them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-c259599e787e422181f986cf2272eb5320240607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C6K-RCR1-JC5B-G0J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>11:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 7, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
