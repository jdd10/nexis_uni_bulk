This is a Jupyter Notebook with some basic Python code to help you get started with using the Lexis Nexis Web Services Kit API to search and bulk download articles from the service instead of being limited to the 1000 articles you can typically download per session using the online interface. You'll need to get access credentials from your service provider (in my case, Princeton University Library) to be able to query the API. Many libraries may not have access, so be sure to check with your library.

There are help documents in the main platform interface (for Princeton, see https://libguides.princeton.edu/az/nexis-uni-former-lexis-nexis-academic). In particular: 
* for a run-down of search commands: https://p.widencdn.net/dykvnj/Nexis_Commands_AtAGlance 
* as well as News searching tips: https://p.widencdn.net/x1tozf/Nexis_News-Searching-Tips. 

There are details in the notebook on searching for sources, but you can also use the source menu in the online interface or see this spreadsheet listing of current content sources: https://supportcenter.lexisnexis.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1098614 (Excel file at bottom of page). 

For help constructing more sophisticated search queries, consult with your academic librarian, who's an expert at this sort of thing.
